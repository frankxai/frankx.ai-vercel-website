# Homepage Redesign Brief - V2
**Clear, Creator-Focused, Conversion-Optimized**

## 🎯 Core Objective
Transform the homepage from abstract/confusing → clear/actionable within 5 seconds of landing.

## ❌ Current Problems

### Hero Section Issues
**Current Headline**: "Transform Ideas Into Exponential Results"
**Problem**: Too abstract, doesn't communicate WHAT you offer

**Current Subheadline**: "Architect the intelligence era with a unified roadmap..."
**Problem**: Jargon-heavy, unclear value proposition

**Current CTAs**: 3 competing options (Download Toolkit, Explore Creator Lab, Join Waitlist)
**Problem**: Decision paralysis, no clear next step

**Current Personas**: 4 vague segments (Launch Artists, Creator Architects, Story Guides, Allies)
**Problem**: Labels unclear, forced self-identification

### Technical Issues
- Heavy animations delay First Meaningful Paint
- Gradient text fails WCAG contrast requirements
- No mobile optimization (animations tank performance)
- Missing social proof above the fold

## ✅ New Homepage Structure

### Section 1: Hero (Above the Fold)
**Purpose**: Answer "What is this?" in 3 seconds

**Headline** (Clear + Benefit-Driven):
```
AI Tools for Creators Who Ship Faster
```
*Alternative*: "Turn Creative Ideas Into Finished Work—Using AI"

**Subheadline** (Specific + Credible):
```
Proven workflows, templates, and music tools used by 12,000+ creators
to launch content, courses, and music releases without burnout.
```

**Primary CTA** (Single, Clear):
```
[Large Cyan Button] Take Free 2-Minute Assessment →
[Subtext] Find which tool fits your creative workflow
```

**Secondary CTA** (Optional):
```
[Ghost Button/Link] Watch 60-Second Demo →
```

**Trust Indicators** (Below CTAs):
```
✓ 500+ Suno Sessions Created
✓ 300+ Creator Systems Built
✓ Featured in [Publication/Community]
```

**Hero Image**:
- Dashboard screenshot showing actual product
- Or: Creator using tool (authentic, not stock)
- Use Nano Banana MCP to generate
- Optimized WebP, lazy loaded

**Animation Strategy**:
- Desktop: Simple fade-in on load (300ms)
- Mobile: No animations (instant paint)
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

### Section 2: Problem/Solution (Scroll-Triggered)
**Purpose**: Validate visitor's pain points

**Structure**:
```

Each testimonial includes:
- Photo (real creator, not stock)
