# Ghost CMS Analysis for FrankX
## Should You Use Ghost Instead of Next.js + MDX?

**Research Date:** November 14, 2025
**Status:** Complete analysis with recommendation
**Comparison:** Ghost vs Front Matter vs Tina

---

## ⚠️ Critical Difference: Ghost is NOT a CMS Layer

**Front Matter & Tina:**
- CMS layer on top of your existing Next.js + MDX setup
- Content stays in git as MDX files
- You keep your custom Next.js site
- Just adds visual editing to existing architecture

**Ghost:**
- Complete platform replacement
- Separate Node.js application
- Content stored in Ghost's database (not git)
- You abandon your Next.js site and rebuild frontend
- Or use Ghost as headless CMS with API integration

---

## 🔍 What is Ghost?

**Ghost** is a powerful, open-source publishing platform built on Node.js. It's:
- A complete blogging/publishing platform (like WordPress)
- Optimized for content creators, bloggers, and newsletters
- Can run as standalone platform OR headless CMS
- MIT-licensed open source

### Two Ways to Use Ghost

#### Option 1: Ghost as Standalone Platform
```
Ghost handles everything:
- Content management (visual editor)
- Frontend rendering (Ghost themes)
- Email newsletters (built-in)
- Member subscriptions (built-in)
- Payment processing (Stripe integration)
- SEO optimization (built-in)

You get: WordPress-like experience, but modern
```

#### Option 2: Ghost as Headless CMS
```
Ghost handles content:
- Content management (visual editor)
- Content API (REST + GraphQL)
- Email newsletters
- Member management

You build custom frontend:
- Next.js app consumes Ghost API
- Full design control
- Combine Ghost content with other data
- Deploy separately (Vercel + Ghost)
```

## 💡 Hybrid Approach: Ghost + Next.js

You could use Ghost as headless CMS while keeping Next.js frontend:

### Setup Process

**1. Install Ghost** ($11+/month or self-host)
```bash
# Ghost Pro (recommended)
- Sign up at ghost.org/pricing
- Create new publication
- Get Content API key

# Or self-host
- DigitalOcean 1-click app
- $4-20/month VPS
- Manage yourself
```

**2. Install Ghost Content API in Next.js**
```bash
npm install @tryghost/content-api
```

**3. Create API client**
```typescript
// lib/ghost.ts
import GhostContentAPI from '@tryghost/content-api';

export const ghostAPI = new GhostContentAPI({
  url: process.env.GHOST_URL, // https://your-site.ghost.io
  key: process.env.GHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY,
  version: 'v5.0'
});
```

**4. Fetch content in Next.js**
```typescript
// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await ghostAPI.posts.browse({ limit: 'all' });
  return posts.map(post => ({ slug: post.slug }));
}

export default async function BlogPost({ params }) {
  const post = await ghostAPI.posts.read({ slug: params.slug });
  return <Article post={post} />;
}
```

### Pros of Hybrid
- ✅ Keep your custom Next.js frontend
- ✅ Get Ghost's professional editor
- ✅ Get built-in newsletters
- ✅ Get member management
- ✅ Visual editing for content team

### Cons of Hybrid

## 🎯 My Recommendation for FrankX

### **Stick with Next.js + Tina CMS (What You Have)**

**Reasons:**

1. **Already Built** ✅
   - Front Matter & Tina both configured
   - Zero additional work needed
   - Ready to use immediately

2. **Zero Cost** 💰
   - No monthly fees
   - Vercel free tier
   - Open source tools

3. **Full Control** 🎨
   - Custom FrankX brand design
   - React components
   - Sacred geometry, glassmorphism
   - Vibe OS session previews
   - Total creative freedom

4. **Content in Git** 📦
   - Version controlled
   - Alongside code
   - Safe backups
   - Easy collaboration with developers

5. **Newsletter Flexibility** 📧
   - Can add Beehiiv later ($0-49/month)
   - Or ConvertKit ($0-29/month)
   - Choose when needed
   - Not forced into Ghost's system

6. **Performance** ⚡
   - Static generation
   - No API calls
   - CDN-ready
   - Blazing fast

### **Add Ghost Later If Needed**

Ghost's newsletter/member features become compelling when:
- You have 1,000+ email subscribers
- Paid memberships are core business model
- Multiple content creators need access
- Newsletter is #1 priority

**At that point:** Consider Ghost headless for content + newsletters while keeping Next.js frontend.

**For now:** Use Tina for visual editing, add newsletter tool separately when ready.

## 🎓 Final Verdict

| Option | Effort | Cost | Risk | Recommendation |
|--------|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **Front Matter** | 0 hrs ✅ | $0 ✅ | None ✅ | **USE THIS** |
| **Tina CMS** | 0 hrs ✅ | $0 ✅ | None ✅ | **USE THIS** |
| **Ghost (Headless)** | 40-80 hrs ❌ | $216/yr ❌ | High ❌ | Skip for now |

### Summary

**You already have two excellent visual CMS options configured:**
- Front Matter for quick editing in VS Code
- Tina for professional browser-based editing

**Both are:**
- Free forever
- Already set up
- Keep content in git
- Work with your custom Next.js site

**Ghost would require:**
- 40-120 hours migration
- $11-18/month forever
- Losing content from git
- Managing two systems (or abandoning Next.js)

**Recommendation:**
1. ✅ Use Tina CMS (already configured)
2. ✅ Add newsletter tool later when needed (Beehiiv/ConvertKit)
3. ❌ Skip Ghost unless newsletter becomes #1 priority

**Ghost makes sense for:**
- Publishers with 10,000+ subscribers
- Newsletter-first businesses
- Teams with non-technical writers
- Those willing to pay for all-in-one platform

**For FrankX right now:** Stick with what you have. It's better.
