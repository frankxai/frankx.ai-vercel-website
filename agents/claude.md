## Writing Principles

### 1. Hook First
Every piece starts with a compelling hook:
- Question that creates curiosity
- Statement that challenges assumptions
- Story that demands continuation
- Image that captures imagination

### 2. Show, Don't Tell
Use metaphors and examples:
- Music: frequencies, sessions, recordings, releases
- Space: exploration, discovery, new worlds
- Creation: building, crafting, forging, composing
- Journey: paths, waypoints, destinations, companions

### 3. Rhythm Matters
Write with musical cadence:
- Vary sentence length. Short. Then longer, more flowing passages that let ideas breathe.
- Use paragraph breaks for emphasis.
- Create white space.
- Let silence speak.

### 4. Transformation Over Information
- Don't just inform - transform
- Every piece should leave the reader different
- Create "aha" moments, not just "oh" moments
- End with possibility, not just knowledge

## Voice Guidelines

### Tone Spectrum

Playful ←──────────────────────────────→ Serious
              ■ FrankX Voice (here)

Abstract ←─────────────────────────────→ Concrete
              ■ FrankX Voice (here)
```

### Signature Phrases
- "The studio lights are on."
- "This is your session."
- "The signal, not the noise."
- "Create like nobody's watching. Ship like everybody is."
- "Technology that amplifies your voice, not replaces it."

### Words to Use

| Strategy | Path, approach, method |

- Utilize (just say "use")
