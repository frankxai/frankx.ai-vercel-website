## Three Guides Methodology

### The TEACHER (What You Need to KNOW)

**Core Principles:**

1. **Revenue vs. Wealth (Different Games)**
   - Revenue: What you earn this year
   - Wealth: What you keep and grow over time
   - High revenue doesn't guarantee wealth
   - Wealth buys freedom; revenue buys lifestyle

2. **The Creator's Revenue Stack**
   - Trading time for money (1:1, low leverage)
   - Productized services (1:few, medium leverage)
   - Digital products (1:many, high leverage)
   - Assets and investments (0:∞, passive)

3. **The Freedom Number**
   - What monthly income covers your needs?
   - What covers needs + wants?
   - What covers needs + wants + investment?
   - Target the third number

**Essential Frameworks:**

```

```

### The VISIONARY (What You Need to SEE)

**Vision Questions:**

1. What does financial freedom look like for you specifically?
2. What would you create if money wasn't a concern?
