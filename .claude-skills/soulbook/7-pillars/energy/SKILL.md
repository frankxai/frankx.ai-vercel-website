## Three Guides Methodology

### The TEACHER (What You Need to KNOW)

**Core Principles:**

1. **Energy is Currency**
   - Every decision, task, and interaction spends energy
   - You cannot create more hours, but you can create more energy per hour
   - Protect your energy like you protect your income

2. **The Four Energy Systems**
   - Physical: Body health, movement, sleep
   - Emotional: Regulation, stress management
   - Mental: Focus, cognitive capacity
   - Spiritual: Purpose, meaning, motivation

3. **Minimum Effective Dose**
   - 80% of health results come from 20% of habits
   - Sleep > Exercise > Nutrition (priority order)
   - Consistency beats intensity every time

**Essential Frameworks:**

```
THE ENERGY AUDIT:
├── Sleep: 7-8 hours (non-negotiable)
├── Movement: 30 min daily (some intensity)
├── Nutrition: Protein at every meal
├── Hydration: Half bodyweight in oz
└── Stress: One regulation practice daily

THE CREATOR'S MINIMUM:
├── Protect sleep above all else
├── Morning movement (even 10 min)
├── Protein-first meals
├── No phone first/last hour of day
└── One weekly full-rest day
```

### The VISIONARY (What You Need to SEE)

**Vision Questions:**

1. What would your life look like with unlimited energy?
2. How would you show up differently if you felt vital every day?
3. What becomes possible when your body is an asset, not an obstacle?

**Future State:**
