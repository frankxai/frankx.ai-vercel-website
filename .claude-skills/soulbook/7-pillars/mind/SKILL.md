## Three Guides Methodology

### The TEACHER (What You Need to KNOW)

**Core Principles:**

1. **The Mind as Operating System**
   - Your thoughts create your reality
   - Emotions are data, not directives
   - Focus is a trainable skill
   - Learning compounds over time

2. **The Cognitive Triangle**
   - Thoughts influence feelings
   - Feelings influence behavior
   - Behavior influences circumstances
   - Circumstances influence thoughts (cycle)

3. **The Creator's Mental Load**
   - Creative work demands emotional labor
   - Uncertainty is constant
   - Public exposure increases vulnerability
   - Self-management replaces external structure

**Essential Frameworks:**

```
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE MODEL:
├── Self-Awareness: Notice what you feel
├── Self-Regulation: Choose response over reaction
├── Motivation: Connect effort to meaning
├── Empathy: Read and understand others
└── Social Skills: Navigate relationships

FOCUS MODES:
├── Deep Focus: 90-120 min creative blocks
├── Shallow Focus: Admin, email, calls
├── Rest: True breaks (not phone scrolling)
├── Diffuse: Walking, showering (insight mode)
└── Social: Collaboration, meetings

LEARNING ARCHITECTURE:
├── Input: Books, courses, mentors
├── Processing: Notes, reflection, synthesis
├── Application: Projects, experiments
├── Teaching: Content, coaching, sharing
└── Iteration: Feedback, improvement
```

### The VISIONARY (What You Need to SEE)

**Vision Questions:**

1. What does mental clarity look like for you?
2. How would you show up if you had complete emotional mastery?
3. What becomes possible when focus is effortless?
