## Three Guides Methodology

### The TEACHER (What You Need to KNOW)

**Core Principles:**

1. **Legacy is Daily, Not Someday**
   - Legacy is built in moments, not monuments
   - Every interaction is a brick
   - Small consistent acts beat grand gestures
   - You're living your legacy now

2. **The Synergy Effect**
   - Strong pillars multiply each other
   - Weak pillars drag others down
   - Balance beats excellence in isolation
   - Integration creates compounding

3. **Quality of Life is the Measure**
   - Not achievement alone
   - Not others' approval
   - Your inner experience of your life
   - Alignment between values and actions

**Essential Frameworks:**

```
THE 7-PILLAR INTEGRATION MODEL:

FOUNDATION PILLARS (Build First):
├── Energy → Powers everything
├── Mind → Directs the power
└── Soul → Guides the direction

GROWTH PILLARS (Enable Achievement):
├── Craft → Creates value
├── Capital → Provides freedom
└── Circle → Multiplies impact

INTEGRATION PILLAR (Unifies All):
└── Legacy → Vision + Quality + Impact

PILLAR SYNERGY:
├── Energy → Craft (vitality for output)
├── Mind → Capital (focus for business)
├── Soul → Circle (values in relationships)
├── Craft → Legacy (work that lasts)
├── Capital → Circle (generosity)
└── All → Legacy (integrated life)

LEGACY PYRAMID:
├── CONTRIBUTIONS (Impact on others)
│   ├── Problems solved
│   ├── Lives changed
│   ├── Community served
│   └── World improved
│
├── CREATIONS (Work that lasts)
│   ├── Body of work
│   ├── Businesses built
│   ├── Ideas contributed
│   └── Art created
│
└── PEOPLE (Influence ripples)
    ├── Family raised
    ├── Mentees developed
    ├── Team grown
    └── Community built
```

### The VISIONARY (What You Need to SEE)

**Vision Questions:**

1. At the end of your life, what do you want to have stood for?
2. What would you do if you couldn't fail?
3. What does a fully integrated, extraordinary life look like for you?

**Future State:**
