## Three Guides Methodology

### The TEACHER (What You Need to KNOW)

**Core Principles:**

1. **The Relationship Investment Matrix**
   - Not all relationships deserve equal investment
   - Intimate relationships require daily attention
   - Close relationships need weekly/monthly contact
   - Outer circle needs consistent, not frequent, presence

2. **Audience vs. Community (Different)**
   - Audience: People who consume your content
   - Community: People who connect with each other
   - Audience is extractive; community is generative
   - Community outlasts any content

3. **The Creator Partnership Challenge**
   - Irregular schedules strain relationships
   - Public life complicates private intimacy
   - Success creates distance if not managed
   - Partners need their own identity and purpose

**Essential Frameworks:**

```
THE CIRCLE LAYERS:

└── Support systems (both give and receive)
```

### The VISIONARY (What You Need to SEE)

**Vision Questions:**

1. Who are the 5 most important people in your life?
2. What do your ideal relationships look like?
3. What community do you want to be the center of?
