## Three Guides Methodology

### The TEACHER (What You Need to KNOW)

**Core Principles:**

1. **Values as Compass**
   - Values are what you actually do, not what you say
   - Aligned action creates fulfillment
   - Misaligned success feels hollow
   - Values can evolve but core stays constant

2. **Purpose is Discovered Through Action**
   - Purpose emerges from serving others
   - Meaning comes from contribution
   - Your purpose can have chapters
   - Purpose is found in the intersection of passion, skill, and need

3. **Character is Destiny**
   - Who you are when no one's watching matters
   - Small integrity builds big trustworthiness
   - Reputation follows character (eventually)
   - Character compounds like interest

**Essential Frameworks:**

```
THE VALUES HIERARCHY:
├── Core Values (3-5): Non-negotiable, define you
├── Secondary Values: Important but flexible
├── Aspirational Values: Who you're becoming
└── Situational Values: Context-dependent

PURPOSE FORMULA:
├── Passion: What energizes you
├── Skill: What you're uniquely good at
├── Need: What the world requires
└── Purpose: Intersection of all three

CHARACTER PILLARS:
├── Integrity: Do what you say
├── Courage: Act despite fear
├── Compassion: Care for others
├── Wisdom: Apply knowledge well
└── Humility: Know your limits
```

### The VISIONARY (What You Need to SEE)

**Vision Questions:**

1. When you're living fully aligned with your values, what does that look like?
2. What is the contribution only you can make?
3. At the end of your life, what do you want to have stood for?

**Future State:**

```
ENVISION YOUR SOUL ALIGNMENT:

DAILY LIFE:
├── Wake with sense of purpose
├── Work aligned with values
├── Decisions feel clear
├── No values violations
└── End day with peace

CHARACTER IN ACTION:
├── Integrity automatic
├── Courage when needed
├── Compassion flows naturally
├── Wisdom in decisions
└── Humility in success

PURPOSE EXPRESSION:
├── Work serves larger mission
├── Contribution is clear
├── Impact is measurable
├── Legacy is building
└── Meaning sustains effort
```

### The DEVELOPER (What You Need to BUILD)

**Implementation Systems:**

```
VALUES CLARIFICATION PROCESS:

STEP 1: EXCAVATION
├── Life peak experiences
├── Life valley experiences
├── What you can't tolerate
├── What you defend fiercely
└── What you secretly admire

STEP 2: ARTICULATION
├── Name 10 possible values
├── Define what each means to YOU
├── Rank by importance
├── Select top 3-5 core values
└── Write your values statement

STEP 3: INTEGRATION
├── How does each show up daily?
├── Where are you out of alignment?
├── What systems support each?
├── How do you course-correct?
└── When do you review?

PURPOSE DISCOVERY PROCESS:

STEP 1: PASSION MAPPING
├── What would you do for free?
├── What makes time disappear?
├── What would you regret not doing?
└── What topic never bores you?

STEP 2: SKILL INVENTORY
├── What comes naturally?
├── What do people ask your help with?
├── What have you mastered?
└── What unique combination do you have?

STEP 3: NEED IDENTIFICATION
├── What problems break your heart?
├── What would you fix in the world?
├── Who do you want to serve?
└── What change do you want to create?

STEP 4: PURPOSE SYNTHESIS
├── Draft purpose statement
├── Test against daily actions
├── Refine until resonant
└── Live it, review quarterly
```
