## Three Guides Methodology

### The TEACHER (What You Need to KNOW)

**Core Principles:**

1. **Mastery is a Process, Not a Destination**
   - The 10,000-hour rule is wrong (it's about how, not just how much)
   - Deliberate practice beats mindless repetition
   - Plateaus are normal; they're where growth happens
   - Every master was once a disaster

2. **Output is the Teacher**
   - You learn by doing, not just studying
   - Ship, get feedback, improve, repeat
   - Finished is better than perfect
   - Volume precedes quality

3. **Craft in the AI Age**
   - AI amplifies but doesn't replace craft
   - The artisan's eye is irreplaceable
   - Human creativity remains the source
   - Tools serve vision, not the reverse

**Essential Frameworks:**

```
THE MASTERY PATH:
├── Novice: Following rules, building basics
├── Competent: Context awareness, judgment
├── Proficient: Intuition emerging, flow possible
├── Expert: Automatic execution, teaching ability
└── Master: Innovation, transcending rules

DELIBERATE PRACTICE:
├── Specific goal for session
├── Focus on weakness, not strength
├── Immediate feedback loop
├── Uncomfortable zone (4-5/10 difficulty)
└── High repetition with attention

OUTPUT SYSTEM:
├── Input: Inspiration, learning, absorption
├── Incubation: Processing, connecting
├── Creation: Production, drafting
├── Refinement: Editing, polishing
└── Distribution: Publishing, sharing
```

### The VISIONARY (What You Need to SEE)

**Vision Questions:**

1. What would mastery of your craft look like?
2. What work do you want to be known for?
3. What would you create if you had no fear?

**Future State:**

```
ENVISION YOUR CRAFT MASTERY:

SKILL LEVEL:
├── Technical excellence automatic
├── Creative vision clear
├── Unique voice developed
├── Work speaks for itself
└── Others seek your teaching

OUTPUT REALITY:
├── Consistent production rhythm
├── Quality standard maintained
├── Growing body of work
├── Work compounds on itself
└── Systems support creativity

RECOGNITION:
├── Work finds its audience
├── Peers respect the craft
├── Revenue reflects value
├── Legacy being built
└── Impact is measurable
```

### The DEVELOPER (What You Need to BUILD)

**Implementation Systems:**

```
SKILL DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM:

MONTHLY FOCUS:
├── Choose one micro-skill to improve
├── Design deliberate practice
├── Schedule practice sessions
├── Seek feedback loop
└── Measure improvement

WEEKLY STRUCTURE:
├── Skill work: 2-3 dedicated sessions
├── Output work: 3-4 creation sessions
├── Review work: 1 quality assessment
├── Learning: 1 study session
└── Rest: 1 full day off

DAILY PRACTICE:
├── Warm-up (5-10 min)
├── Skill practice (30-60 min)
├── Creation work (variable)
├── Quality check (end of session)
└── Tomorrow prep (5 min)

OUTPUT SYSTEM:

THE CREATOR'S WORKFLOW:
├── Capture: All ideas, inspirations
├── Clarify: What is this? What's needed?
├── Create: First draft, ship fast
├── Refine: Edit, polish, perfect
├── Release: Publish, distribute
├── Review: What worked? What didn't?
└── Repeat: Back to capture

CONSISTENCY SYSTEM:
├── Non-negotiable creative time
├── Minimum viable output (even bad)
├── Batch similar tasks
├── Protect best hours for creation
└── Track what you ship
```
