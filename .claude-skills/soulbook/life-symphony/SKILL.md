## The 7 Movements

### MOVEMENT 1: RHYTHM (Energy)
*"The beat that drives everything"*

Your rhythm is your physical foundation - the pulse that keeps you moving.

**Key Questions:**
- Is your tempo sustainable?

**Composition Exercise:**
"What's the tempo of your ideal day? Write out the BPM of each hour."

### MOVEMENT 2: MELODY (Mind)
*"The tune that runs through your thoughts"*

Your melody is your mental and emotional life - the music playing in your head.

**Musical Elements:**
- Notes (individual thoughts)
- Phrases (thought patterns)
- Motifs (recurring themes)
- Key signature (emotional baseline)

**Key Questions:**
- What melody plays on repeat?
- Is it in a major or minor key?
- What motifs keep returning?
- Can you change the key?

**Composition Exercise:**
"If your dominant thought pattern were a melody, would you want to listen to it? Write a new one."

### MOVEMENT 3: HARMONY (Soul)
*"When all parts align in resonance"*

Your harmony is when your values, actions, and purpose align - true consonance.

- Performance (delivery)

**Key Questions:**

### MOVEMENT 5: AMPLIFICATION (Capital)
*"How far your music travels"*

Your amplification is your reach and resources - turning up the volume on your impact.

**Musical Elements:**

**Key Questions:**
- How loud is your signal?
- What channels carry your music?
- Are you investing in production?
- Are you earning from your art?

**Composition Exercise:**
"If your creative work were on a mixing board, which faders need to come up?"

*"The players in your orchestra"*

Your ensemble is your relationships - the musicians who play alongside you.

**Composition Exercise:**
"Cast your orchestra. Who plays what? Who's missing?"
