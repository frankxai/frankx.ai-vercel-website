# Social Life - Personal Mastery

## Frank's Context

**Current State Assessment:**
- Building creator community as core asset
- Balancing online community with in-person connections
- Entrepreneurial journey can be isolating
- Need for peer relationships (other creators/entrepreneurs)
- Community building as both personal and professional priority

**Key Goals:**
- Maintain meaningful friendships despite busy schedule
- Build peer group of high-performing creators
- Create genuine community, not just audience
- Balance solo deep work with social connection
- Avoid isolation trap of entrepreneurship

**Personal Philosophy:**
"We're wired for connection. No achievement replaces belonging. The creator journey can be lonely, but it doesn't have to be. Build your crew."
