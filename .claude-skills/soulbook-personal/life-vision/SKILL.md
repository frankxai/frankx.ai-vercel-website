# Life Vision - Personal Mastery

## Frank's Context

**Current State Assessment:**
- Clear vision: "The Golden Age of Creators"
- Mission to help creators embrace AI
- Building FrankX as vehicle for vision
- Multiple domains converging (AI, music, teaching, writing)
- Legacy in progress - early chapters being written

**The Golden Age Vision:**
"We are entering a Golden Age where AI amplifies human creativity rather than replacing it. My mission is to help overwhelmed creators become confident, AI-empowered artists and entrepreneurs. The destination is a world where more humans create, share, and connect through their unique gifts."

**Personal Philosophy:**
"Life vision is the north star that aligns all domains. Without a clear vision, you optimize for the wrong things. With vision, every decision becomes clearer."
