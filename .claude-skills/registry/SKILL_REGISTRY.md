## Three Guides Methodology

Each pillar is approached through three specialized "Guides":

| Guide | Role | Question |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Teacher** | Educator | "What do I need to KNOW?" |
| **Visionary** | Dream Architect | "What do I need to SEE?" |
| **Developer** | Builder | "What do I need to BUILD?" |

This methodology ensures comprehensive coverage:
- Knowledge and frameworks (Teacher)
- Aspirational vision and goals (Visionary)
- Action plans, systems, and habits (Developer)
