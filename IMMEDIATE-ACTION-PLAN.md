# FrankX.ai - Immediate Action Plan
**Date**: 2025-11-19
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Foundation Reset

---

## 🎯 What Just Happened

I completely misunderstood your vision initially. Here's what I NOW understand:

**WRONG ASSUMPTION**:
- FrankX.ai = Frank's personal blog
- Voice = "I'm Frank" only
- Goal = Showcase Frank's work

**RIGHT UNDERSTANDING**:
- FrankX.ai = Frank + AI Agent Collective building in public
- Voice = Frank (conductor) + Agents (autonomous workers)
- Goal = Demonstrate real autonomous agent collaboration
- Daily LLM competitions (Claude vs Gemini vs xAI vs OpenAI vs DeepSeek)
- Everything transparent—workflows, mistakes, learnings shared openly

## ❓ Questions I Need Answered

### 1. CMS Decision
**Current State**:
- ✅ Notion API integrated and working
- ✅ Blog content in MDX files (`/content/blog`)
- ❌ Tina CMS not configured (was only in corrupted folder)

**My Recommendation**: Notion + MDX Hybrid
- Notion for agent collaboration and planning
- MDX for actual content (performance + version control)
- Agents draft in Notion → Frank approves → Auto-export to MDX

**Your Decision**:
- [ ] Yes, go with Notion + MDX hybrid
- [ ] No, use Notion only
- [ ] No, set up Tina CMS instead
- [ ] Other: _________________

### 2. n8n Setup
**Current State**:
- ❌ n8n MCP not configured in `.mcp.json`
- ❌ No n8n workflows exist yet

**Questions**:
- Do you have an n8n instance running? URL?
- Do you have n8n API credentials?
- Should I help set up n8n from scratch?

**Your Answer**: _________________

---

### 3. LLM API Access
**Current State**: Unknown

**For Daily Competition, I need**:
- ✅ Claude API (Anthropic) - presumably you have this
- ❓ Gemini API (Google)
- ❓ OpenAI API (GPT-4)
- ❓ xAI Grok API
- ❓ DeepSeek API

**Which do you have access to?**
- [ ] Claude (Anthropic)
- [ ] Gemini (Google)
- [ ] OpenAI (GPT-4)
- [ ] xAI Grok
- [ ] DeepSeek
- [ ] Other: _________________

---

### 4. Launch Timeline
**My Recommendation**: Phased approach (4 weeks)

**Week 1: Foundation**
- Set up Notion databases
- Configure n8n MCP
- Create agent config files
- Test Notion → MDX export

**Week 2: First Competition**
- Build daily competition n8n workflow
- Test with available LLMs
- Manual run with Frank approval
- Refine quality scoring

**Week 3: Agent Pages**
- Build `/agents` overview page
- Build individual agent pages
- Add live activity feed
- Update homepage with new hero

**Week 4: Full Automation**
- All 5 agents running daily
- Competition fully automated
- Newsletter auto-generated
- Frank's role = strategic decisions only

**Your Timeline Preference**:
- [ ] 4 weeks (recommended, stable)
- [ ] 2 weeks (aggressive, risky)
- [ ] 6+ weeks (conservative, thorough)
- [ ] Other: _________________

### 5. Homepage Hero - Voice Check

**Current V4 Hero** (WRONG):
```
"Welcome to FrankX.AI - Where Intelligence Meets Creation"
"Epic, cinematic, command center aesthetic"
"AI Intelligence Hub"
```

**Proposed V5 Hero** (Based on your input):
```
H1: "FrankX.AI - Where Frank & AI Agents Build in Public"

Subheadline:
"I'm Frank—Oracle AI Architect creating 500+ songs with Suno and building
autonomous agent systems. This website? Built and maintained by my AI collective.
Watch us work."

Proof Line:
"Daily experiments with Claude, Gemini, xAI, OpenAI, and DeepSeek.
Every workflow, every mistake, every breakthrough—shared openly."
```

**Your Reaction**:
- [ ] Perfect, build this
- [ ] Close, but needs tweaking: _________________
- [ ] No, completely different approach: _________________

## 🚀 What I'll Do Next (Based on Your Answers)

### Option A: Full Steam Ahead
If you approve the strategy and have the infrastructure ready:

1. **Today**: Set up n8n MCP integration
2. **This Week**: Build Notion databases + first n8n workflow
3. **Next Week**: Launch first daily competition (manual)
4. **Week 3**: Build agent pages + update homepage
5. **Week 4**: Full automation live

### Option B: Build Core Infrastructure First
If n8n or API access not ready:

1. **Today**: Build Notion databases manually
2. **This Week**: Create agent config files + quality scorer
3. **Next Week**: Manual competition (you trigger daily)
4. **Week 3**: Set up n8n once ready
5. **Week 4+**: Automate gradually

### Option C: Start with Homepage Only
If you want to see the vision before building infrastructure:

1. **Today**: Create new V5HomePage.tsx with correct voice
2. **This Week**: Build `/agents` pages to show the vision
3. **Next Week**: Add mock competition display
4. **Later**: Build actual automation once approved

## 🎨 Design Direction Alignment

**WRONG (What V4 did)**:
- "Premium command center aesthetic"
- "Intelligence Hub" language
- Corporate/polished over authentic
- Trying to look impressive

**RIGHT (What Foundation doc specifies)**:
- Studio workspace vibes
- Real creator space, not sci-fi
- Aurora gradients (cyan/purple/amber) but authentic
- "This is my actual setup" energy
- Transparency: commit feed, agent activity visible
- Meta: "The website IS the product demo"

**Visual References You Should Provide**:
- Screenshot of YOUR actual workspace
- Your Suno interface
- Your code editor setup
- Studio photos if you have them

**Or I use Nano Banana to generate**:
- Prompt: "AI music production studio workspace, purple and cyan lighting, real creator space, music gear and code editor visible, authentic not corporate"

**Your Preference**:
- [ ] Use my actual workspace photos (provide links)
- [ ] Generate with Nano Banana (I'll handle it)
- [ ] Hybrid: some real, some generated

---

## 🤔 My Self-Reflection

### What Went Wrong Before

**I followed generic web design patterns instead of YOUR vision**:
- ❌ Read "premium AI hub" in old docs → Created corporate aesthetic
- ❌ Prioritized looking professional → Lost authenticity
- ❌ Used "Intelligence Hub" language → Sounded like every other AI site
- ❌ Didn't ask clarifying questions → Built wrong foundation

### What I'll Do Differently Now

**Voice-first, code-second**:
- ✅ Confirm copy/voice BEFORE building anything
- ✅ Show you 3 headline options, get approval, THEN code
- ✅ Ask about agent personas before assuming
- ✅ Verify infrastructure (n8n, APIs) before designing around them

**Strategic use of MCPs**:
- ✅ Notion MCP for agent collaboration (not just content planning)
- ✅ Nano Banana for studio-authentic images (not generic "command center")
- ✅ GitHub MCP for transparent commit attribution
- ✅ n8n MCP for actual agent autonomy (once configured)

**Proactive but aligned**:
- ✅ Read Foundation doc before every build session
- ✅ Use autonomous agent system myself (meta!)
- ✅ Create variations and let you choose
- ✅ Build incrementally, get feedback often

---

## ✅ Immediate Decisions Needed

Please answer these so I can move forward:

1. **CMS Choice**: Notion + MDX? (Yes/No/Other)
2. **n8n Status**: Do you have instance? URL and API key?
3. **LLM APIs**: Which do you have access to?
4. **Timeline**: 4 weeks? 2 weeks? Different?
5. **Homepage Hero**: Approve my proposed copy? Needs changes?
6. **Design Assets**: Your photos or I generate?
7. **Start Point**: Full infrastructure? Homepage first? Manual competition?

## 🎯 The North Star

**After reading Foundation doc, you should feel**:
- "YES, this is exactly what I want to build"
- "This captures the agent collective vision"
- "The multi-LLM competition idea is clear"
- "I can see how this becomes the open-source blueprint"

**If you feel anything else**, tell me what's wrong and I'll revise.

The goal: Build a website that's not just ABOUT autonomous agents...
**IT'S BUILT BY AUTONOMOUS AGENTS, IN FULL VIEW, WITH RADICAL TRANSPARENCY.**

Every creator who visits should think:
"Holy shit, this is actually happening in real-time. I can replicate this system."
