## 🚫 What NOT to Build (Yet)

### **Defer These Until Year 2:**

❌ **Mobile Apps**
- Wait until web product-market fit is proven
- Web-first = faster iteration

❌ **Complex Social Features**
- Messaging, notifications, feeds
- Focus on core creation first
- Add social later for retention

❌ **Custom AI Model Training**
- Use existing APIs (Suno, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Expensive and slow
- Add when revenue supports it

❌ **Physical Products**
- No merch, books, events yet
- Digital-first = scalable
- Add physical for brand later

❌ **Enterprise Sales Team**
- No B2B outreach yet
- Focus on creator B2C
- Enterprise comes naturally with brand
