# FrankX Product Funnel Architecture
## Systems-First Value Ladder

*Internal Reference Document | Version 1.0 | January 2026*

---

## Executive Overview

This document maps the complete FrankX product ecosystem as an interconnected system of value delivery. Like a well-orchestrated composition, each tier builds upon the previous, creating a harmonious journey from first contact to high-value partnership.

**Core Philosophy:** Products are not sold, they are systems that are forked.

**Brand DNA Applied:**
```
Frank = Systems Architect x Composer x Gamer x Builder x GenCreator

The funnel mirrors this identity:
- Systems Architect  = Clear structure, measurable progression
- Composer           = Each tier harmonizes with the next
- Gamer              = Achievement unlocks, leveling up
- Builder            = Ship at every tier, not just consume
- GenCreator         = Transform from user to architect
```
