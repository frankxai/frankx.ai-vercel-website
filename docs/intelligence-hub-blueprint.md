3. Music release -> Segment (Music Explorers) -> Vibe OS page -> Latest Sessions grid -> Realm studio invite.
4. Story immersion -> Hero quick action -> Creation Chronicles hub -> Essay or drop -> Inner Circle CTA.
5. Agent builder loop -> Persona band (Agent Builders) -> Guides library -> Automation article -> Creator Lab OS cohort application.

## Measurement Signals
- `creator_funnel_step` counts by location (hero, offer, final-cta, realm).
- `music_session_play` interactions on Vibe OS and Resources music sections.
- Waitlist submissions tagged `realm_waitlist_join` and `music_academy_waitlist`.
- Template and guide downloads tracked via `toolkit_download`.
- Newsletter opt-ins segmented by persona tag.

## Agent Enablement Notes
- `lib/analytics.ts` buffers events so Strategist and Analytics agents can review funnels before pushing upstream.
- `data/products.json` keeps offers, CTAs, and guarantees in sync across product pages.
- Pods are documented in `docs/pods/*` with KPIs and cadences; agents should log wins and blockers there.
- `docs/strategy/v2` holds the live blueprint; archive material sits under `docs/strategy/v1` for reference.
- Agents should refresh interlinking each sprint to keep momentum focused on creators, music explorers, and realm allies.
