# Video Vault Strategy: The "Genius" Embed Protocol

## 🎯 Objective
To transform FrankX.ai into a high-authority "Learning Hub" by strategically embedding the world's best AI and Creator Economy content. This protocol ensures we leverage external authority (Karpathy, Willison, etc.) to validate our own "Agentic Creator" systems.

## 🏗️ The 4-Tier Integration Strategy

### 1. The "Authority Bridge" (Top 3 Priority)
Embed high-signal videos directly within related long-form articles.
*   **Why**: Decreases bounce rate and signals to Google that we provide a "comprehensive" resource.
*   **How**: Use the `<YouTubeEmbed />` component with custom timestamps to skip fluff.

### 2. The "State Prime" (Rituals Page)
Embed functional videos (Binaural, Lofi, Guided Meditation) in the Rituals hub.
*   **Why**: Makes the site a "tool" rather than just a blog. Users come back daily to "prime" their state.
*   **How**: Integrated into the "Activate Ritual" cards.

### 3. The "Video Vault" (Global Index)
A searchable registry of 100+ videos indexed by **Persona** (Architect, Creator, Investor, Student).
*   **Why**: Provides a "Netlifx for AI Learning" experience.
*   **How**: Data-driven page at `/watch` or `/youtube` that filters `data/video-vault-100.json`.

### 4. The "Opus Pipeline" (Future)
Using the curated list to generate short-form "Insight Clips" via Opus.pro.
*   **Why**: Repurposes high-quality long-form into snackable FrankX-branded content.
*   **How**: Map `timestamps` in the JSON to specific "AHA moments" for batch processing.
