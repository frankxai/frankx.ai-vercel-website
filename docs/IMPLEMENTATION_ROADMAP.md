open https://uptimerobot.com
```

**Emergency Contacts:**

| Avg Session | 1.5min | ? | ? | ? | 4+min |
| Conversion Rate | 2% | ? | ? | ? | 8-10% |

---

## Rollout Strategy

### Progressive Enhancement Approach

**Option 1: Big Bang Launch** (Recommended if all QA passes)
- Week 4, Day 25: Full cutover to new site
- All pages go live simultaneously
- Highest impact, cleanest user experience

**Option 2: Phased Rollout** (If risk-averse)
- Week 4, Day 25: Launch new homepage only
- Week 5: Add product pages
- Week 6: Migrate all remaining pages
- Lower risk, but fragmented UX

**Recommendation:** Big Bang Launch with solid rollback plan

### Feature Flags (Optional Safety Net)

```typescript
// lib/features.ts
export const features = {
  newHomepage: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NEW_HOMEPAGE === 'true',
  notionCMS: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NOTION_CMS === 'true',
  betaAssessment: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_BETA_ASSESSMENT === 'true',
}

// Use in components
if (features.newHomepage) {
  return <NewHomePage />
} else {
  return <LegacyHomePage />
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| DNS propagation delay | Medium | Low | Start DNS config on Day 1, 48h buffer |
| Notion API rate limits | Medium | Medium | Aggressive caching, fallback to MDX |
| SEO ranking drop | Low | High | Keep URLs same, proper redirects |
| Browser compatibility | Low | Medium | Cross-browser testing in Week 3 |
| Performance regression | Medium | Medium | Lighthouse CI, performance monitoring |
| User confusion | Low | Medium | Clear navigation, onboarding tooltips |

### Rollback Plans

**Level 1: Quick Fix** (< 5 minutes)
- Hot patch via Vercel dashboard
- Promote previous deployment

**Level 2: Git Revert** (< 15 minutes)
- Revert merge commit
- Auto-redeploy

**Level 3: Full Rollback** (< 30 minutes)
