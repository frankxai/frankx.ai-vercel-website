## 🎬 5 Distinct Video Concepts
*Strategic "Proof of Work" content to validate the Agentic Creator OS.*

| Concept | Storyline | KPI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **Conscious Automation** | Building an n8n pipeline that filters for "Soul" before publishing. How to avoid the "AI Slop" trap. | **Email Opt-ins** |

## 🏛️ 2 Content Strategy Pillars
*The DNA of the FrankX brand presence.*

### Pillar 1: Technical Authority (The "Rigor" DNA)
*   **Definition**: Every claim must be backed by a running system or a peer-reviewed source.
*   **Execution**: Multi-cloud comparisons, code walkthroughs, and architecture diagrams.
*   **KPI**: **Domain Authority (DR)**.

### Pillar 2: Creative Resonance (The "Soul" DNA)
*   **Definition**: Technology is only as good as the state of mind it produces in the user.
*   **Execution**: Rituals, Focus music, and philosophical inquiries into human-AI partnership.
*   **KPI**: **Sentiment Score** (Community Feedback).
