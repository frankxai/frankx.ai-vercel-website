## Content Style Guidelines

### Frank's Voice (Top Creator Pattern)
- **Opening:** Personal stake ("I spent...", "I found...", "I built...")
- **Middle:** Real numbers, concrete examples, lessons learned
- **Closing:** Direct question to audience (drives engagement)

### Format Rules
- No generic AI language ("revolutionize", "game-changing", "cutting-edge")
- No markdown in final output (clean paste-ready text)
- LinkedIn: 1,500-2,500 chars optimal
- Twitter: 8-12 tweet threads, each under 280 chars

### Hook Patterns (Educational/Story-driven)
1. "I spent [time] doing [thing]. Here's what I learned."
2. "Everyone's doing [X]. But after [experience], I found [Y] works better."
3. "The [topic] nobody's talking about:"
4. "I built [thing]. Took [time]. Here's the system."
5. "[Number] [things] later, here's what actually works."
