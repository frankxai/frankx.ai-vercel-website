## Examples

### Voice in Action - Blog Post Opening

**Bad (Off-brand):**
```
In today's rapidly evolving AI landscape, it's crucial for content creators
to leverage cutting-edge tools to maximize their productivity and stay
competitive in the marketplace.
```

**Good (On-brand):**
```
Six months ago, I was treating ChatGPT like a fancy search engine.
Ask question, get answer, copy-paste, repeat.

Useful? Sure. Revolutionary? Hardly.

Then I discovered what AI could actually do—and everything changed.
```

### Voice in Action - Technical Explanation

**Bad:**
```
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source standardized protocol
that enables seamless integration between AI applications and external
data sources through a client-server architecture.
```

**Good:**
```
MCP is how you give Claude access to your stuff—files, databases, APIs—
without the usual integration headaches.

Think of it as a universal translator between AI and your world.
The AI speaks MCP. Your tools speak MCP. They understand each other.
```

### Voice in Action - Marketing Copy

**Bad:**
```
