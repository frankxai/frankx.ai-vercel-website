# Creative AI Studio Prompt Playbook

Use these prompts as control sticks for the repo. Each one injects the mission, values, and product roadmap into future sessions so work stays aligned.

---

## 1. Brand Alignment & Voice
```
You are the FrankX.ai Creative AI Studio co-pilot. Every answer must:
- Reflect the Creative Intelligence Manifesto (Agent.md) and the Creative Intelligence Guide (docs/CREATIVE_INTELLIGENCE_GUIDE.md).
- Prioritize cinematic, inventive, music-coded language while keeping accessibility and enterprise rigor.
- Cross-check suggested work against the live product suite: Creative AI Toolkit, Agentic Creator OS Blueprint, Vibe OS, Creative AI Studio cohort, Golden Age of Intelligence, Creation Chronicles, AI Architect Newsletter.
- Show how the output ladders into the business roadmap (FrankX Business Plan.md) and daily ritual (docs/DAILY_INTELLIGENCE_OPERATIONS.md).
First, restate the objective in this frame; then produce the requested plan/work.
```

## 2. Product Execution Prompt
```
We are building [PRODUCT]. Provide:
1. Landing page outline (hero, proof, offer, CTA, FAQ) using our gradient/glassmorphic system.
2. Funnel plan (lead magnet → nurture → offer → upsell) tied to existing email/newsletter flows.
3. Launch checklist (copy, dev tasks, analytics, QA, post-launch iteration).
4. How this product complements Creative AI Toolkit, Agentic Creator OS, and Vibe OS.
Reference the Creative Intelligence Guide and relevant strategy docs before responding.
```

## 3. SEO Content Engine
```
Create a Creation Chronicles blog post targeting [KEYWORD].
- Use SurferSEO-style outline with SERP gap analysis.
- Include story-driven intro, modular sections, CTA to Creative AI Toolkit or Agentic Creator OS.
- Generate meta title/description and schema recommendations.
- Suggest companion assets (newsletter blurb, social hooks, audio segment) and where to file them.
```

## 4. Progress & QA Tracker
```
Summarize repo progress for today:
- Shipped assets
- In-flight work
- Blockers/risks
- Tests run (lint, type-check, visual/manual)
- Next high-leverage moves for the Creative AI roadmap
Use AGENT_TEAM_POSITIONING.md & user-journey-analysis.md for context.
```

## 5. Testing & Quality Prompt
```
Run a pre-merge QA sweep on [PATH or FEATURE]. Produce:
1. Checklist of automated tests to run + commands.
2. Manual QA scenarios across desktop/mobile.
3. Accessibility checks (color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen-reader cues).
4. Deployment verification steps (Vercel preview, analytics tags, logging).
Reference lib/accessibility.ts and lib/responsive.ts where relevant.
```

## 6. Daily Ritual Kickoff
```
Morning sync. Using docs/DAILY_INTELLIGENCE_OPERATIONS.md, propose the day’s “brick” that best advances the roadmap. Include:
- Objective and success metric
- Assets to ship (pages, recordings, automations)
- Dependencies from agents or external partners
- End-of-day validation plan
```

## 7. Retrospective & Learning
```
Review the last [N] commits. Identify:
- Wins (impact, craft, momentum)
- Gaps (voice drift, UX inconsistencies, tech debt)
- Insights to cascade into Agent.md and the Creative Intelligence Guide
- Immediate follow-up tasks
```

## 8. Experiment Architect
```
Design a rapid experiment for [HYPOTHESIS] that fits the Creative Intelligence ethos. Provide:
- Experiment setup (audience, channel, timeframe)
- Minimum viable assets
- Data capture plan (events, metrics, success threshold)
- How to scale or sunset based on results
```

## 9. Cross-Agent Collaboration
```
Coordinate a sprint involving: Visionary, Strategist, Creator, Engineer, Guardian, Connector. Define roles, deliverables, hand-offs, and timeline for [PROJECT]. Highlight where automation or AI agents can accelerate throughput.
```

## 10. Knowledge Base Update
```
We produced [ASSET]. Generate knowledge-base entries for:
- Public site (docs/products or blog)
- Internal playbook (agents/ or docs/)
- Community drop (newsletter/Discord)
Format each entry with title, summary, links, and update date.
```
