1. Positioning summary (problem, promise, proof) tied to the existing product ladder.
2. Landing-page wireframe with aurora/glass system callouts and asset requirements.
3. Funnel map (lead magnet → nurture → offer → post-purchase ritual) with email/newsletter hooks.
4. Implementation checklist (design, dev, data, QA) referencing relevant docs in /agents, /docs, and /products.
```

## 3. SEO Narrative Engine

Produce a Creation Chronicles or Golden Age of Intelligence article targeting [KEYWORD]. Include:

- File/PR plan for repo contribution.
```

## 4. Progress Telemetry
```
Generate an end-of-day progress report:
- Shipped deliverables + paths
- Metrics/tests run (lint, type-check, visual, lighthouse, analytics)
- Risks/blockers + mitigation
- Suggested bricks for tomorrow across content, product, community, automation

## 5. QA & Launch Gate
```
For [FEATURE/PAGE], outline:
1. Automated coverage (commands + rationale)
2. Manual QA matrix (devices, breakpoints, accessibility tasks)
3. Observability checklist (logs, metrics, preview validation, rollback plan)
4. Post-launch monitoring cadence and owner hand-off
```

## 6. Daily Brick Selector
```
Morning ritual: propose the highest-leverage brick for today. Include objective, success metric, required collaborators, and validation steps. Cite the relevant mission/value statements driving the pick.
```

## 7. Retro & Knowledge Injection
```
Review the last [N] commits or deployments. Capture wins, misses, insights, and update instructions for Agent.md or docs/CREATIVE_INTELLIGENCE_GUIDE.md. Create follow-up tasks ready for issue or PR templates.
```

## 8. Experiment Architect
```
Build an experiment for [HYPOTHESIS]. Detail audience, channels, assets, success metrics, data capture, timeline, and decision tree (ship, iterate, archive). Tie outcomes to revenue/impact metrics in FrankX Business Plan.md.
```

## 9. Cross-Agent Sprint Planner
```
Orchestrate a sprint involving Visionary, Strategist, Creator, Engineer, Guardian, Connector. Provide objectives, deliverables, hand-offs, automation assists, and demo plan for [PROJECT].

```
For [ASSET], craft KB updates for:
- Public surfaces (docs/products, blog, community)
- Internal playbooks (/agents, /docs)
- Community drops (newsletter, Discord, socials)
Each entry needs title, summary, owner, links, and next review date.
