# Strategy v1 Index (Legacy Mix)
_Last updated: 2025-09-28_

Legacy positioning files that blended creator, family, and enterprise priorities remain in place for context. Use them only for historical reference.

## Master Documents
- `Agent.md` - original mission + operating loop that mixed enterprise/creator language.
- `Frankx Vision mission values.md` - personal philosophy, tone and long-form brand origin story.
- `FrankX Business Plan.md` - revenue models, offers, and product hierarchies before the creator-first reset.
- `docs/PRODUCT_ORG_BLUEPRINT.md` - pod cadences and operating reviews created during the multi-segment phase.
- `docs/intelligence-hub-blueprint.md` - navigation + hub logic mapping creators, family, and enterprise pathways.

## Offer & Funnel References
- `data/products.json` (pre-reset rows `agentic-creator-os`, `generative-creator-os`) - enterprise-centric messaging now superseded by v2 updates.
- `app/products/agentic-creator-os/page.tsx` (pre-update) - enterprise CTA flows.
- `app/agents/page.tsx` + `lib/agents.ts` (pre-update) - agent archetypes tuned for enterprise governance.

## Audience Experiments
- `docs/user-journey-analysis.md` - segmentation notes covering creators, enterprises, and families.
- `DIGITAL_PRODUCTS_STRATEGY.md` - bundle concepts for enterprise retainers and family kits.
- `content/blog/*` essays tagged `Enterprise` or `Family` - use for archival storytelling only.
