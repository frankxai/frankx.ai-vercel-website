# Grand Slam Offers (Creator-First V2)

## Principles
- Lead with studio-energy promises tied to a specific release, not abstract business outcomes.
- Compress time-to-momentum: every paid tier delivers a tangible song, drop, or system inside the first 14 days.
- Stack proof and instrumentation so creators feel guided by data and community, never left to self-study.
- Keep language cinematic and personal; every module feels like stepping into Frank's studio, not a corporate curriculum.

## ICP Focus: Launch Artists Ready for Momentum
- Independent musicians and sonic storytellers who already create but lack a reliable release cadence.
- Value bespoke Suno workflows, vibe curation, and accountability that respects artistic integrity.
- Will invest at premium levels when the offer guarantees released music plus monetization pathways.
- Need fast wins (new track or drop this month) and a longer arc (recurring release + audience growth).

## Flagship Grand Slam Offer: Vibe OS Residency
**Tagline:** "Ship four soul-aligned drops in 90 days with Frank in your corner."

### Hormozi Value Equation
| Lever | How We Amplify |
| --- | --- |
| Dream Outcome | 4 finished tracks + release rituals + monetized drop assets + audience telemetry |
| Perceived Likelihood | Weekly live studio sessions, agent desk support, shared metrics dashboard |
| Time Delay | Track 1 engineered and released within 14 days, weekly milestones thereafter |
| Effort & Sacrifice | We build prompts, stems, art, funnels, and automation so artist stays in creative pocket |

### Unique Value Proposition
- Professional Suno prompt engineering tuned to the artist's frequency and narrative.
- End-to-end release system: music, story, visuals, landing page, and analytics instrumentation.

## Supporting Offer Ladder (Keep Creator-First Flow)
1. **Signal (Free)** – Creation Chronicles + "24h Release Ritual" PDF. Goal: enroll 30% into Launchpad.

## Implementation Backbone for Codex & Team
- Build `products/vibe-os/residency.md` outlining curriculum, milestones, and analytics hooks.
- Update `data/products.json` with Residency tier (ensure voice matches creator blueprint, remove enterprise language).
- Extend funnel component in `/components/funnels` for Residency application flow (CTA triggers `creator_funnel_step`).
- Draft acceptance and onboarding automations (Notion template + email sequence) so handoffs stay tight.
- Coordinate with Claude for sales page narrative and with Gemini for performance guardrails.

## Next Moves
1. Codex drafts Residency curriculum doc + updates product registry entries for Vibe OS tiers.
2. Claude crafts sales narrative + application emails using creator-first tone.
3. Gemini prepares instrumentation checklist (lint/test + analytics validation) before launch.
