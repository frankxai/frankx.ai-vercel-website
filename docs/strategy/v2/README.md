### 4. 📖 CREATOR-FIRST BLUEPRINT
**File**: `CREATOR-FIRST-BLUEPRINT.md`

**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY SUPERSEDED**

**What's Still Relevant**:
- Audience lanes (Launch Artists, Creator Architects, etc.)
- Offer ladder (Free → Entry Kits → Deep Practice → Inner Circle)
- Content & experience rules
- Analytics tracking events

**What's Superseded**:
- Voice guidelines (see Foundation doc for dual voice system)
- Agent collaboration (see Foundation for autonomous agents)

**When to Read**: After Foundation, for audience and product context

**Read Time**: 10 minutes

### 5. 🤖 AGENT OPERATING CODE
**File**: `AGENT-OPERATING-CODE.md`

**Status**: ⚠️ **NEEDS UPDATE**

**What's Still Relevant**:
- Claude/Gemini/Codex role snapshots

### 6. 📊 AGENT TEAM POSITIONING
**File**: `../../AGENT_TEAM_POSITIONING.md`

**Status**: ⚠️ **OUTDATED - DO NOT USE**

**Issues**:
- Talks about moving FROM personal brand TO agent collective (wrong framing)
- Uses 6 agents (Strategist, Creator, Engineer, Guardian, Connector, Visionary)
- Foundation doc specifies 5 domain agents (Newsletter, Blog, Product, Landing Page, Funnel)
- Corporate language ("institutional authority", "systematic excellence")

**When to Read**: Only for historical context of what NOT to do

## 🚦 Quick Decision Tree

### "I want to understand the vision"
→ Read: **Foundation** → **Action Plan**

### "I want to build the system"
→ Read: **Foundation** → **Implementation Blueprint** → **Action Plan**

### "I want to write content"
→ Read: **Foundation** (voice section) → Check agent domain ownership

### "I'm Claude Code continuing work"
→ Read: **Foundation** (skim) → **Implementation Blueprint** (relevant section) → Check `/CLAUDE.md`

### "I want to know product strategy"
→ Read: **Foundation** → **Creator-First Blueprint** (products section)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Superseded Documents

**These old docs should NOT guide decisions**:
- `V3_TRANSFORMATION_STRATEGY.md` (old identity crisis diagnosis)
- `FRANKX-V5-CONTENT-ENHANCEMENT-STRATEGY.md` (still uses "Intelligence Hub")
- `AGENT_TEAM_POSITIONING.md` (wrong agent architecture)

**Why they're wrong**:
- Based on "Frank's personal blog" assumption
- Corporate positioning language
- Missing multi-LLM competition concept
- No n8n automation infrastructure
- 6 agents instead of 5 domain agents

### What Changed (Nov 19, 2025)

**Old Understanding**:
- FrankX.ai = Frank's personal blog
- Voice = "I'm Frank" only
- Trying to sound professional

**New Understanding**:
- FrankX.ai = Frank + AI Agent Collective
- Voice = Dual system (Frank + Agents)
- Authentic studio vibes, not corporate
- Daily LLM competitions
- Radical transparency
- The website IS the product demo
