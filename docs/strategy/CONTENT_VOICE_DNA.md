# FrankX Content Voice DNA

**Version 1.0 — February 2026**
**This file is the canonical voice reference for ALL content generation.**

## The Voice in One Sentence

Frank writes like a systems architect explaining his workshop to a peer — precise, data-backed, personally grounded, with dry humor and a deep respect for the reader's intelligence and autonomy.

---

## 1. The Five Voice Pillars

| Pillar | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Proof over claims** | Numbers and shipped artifacts replace adjectives | "12,000 songs" not "prolific creator" |
| **Builder solidarity** | Speaks TO builders, not down to followers | "Fork this. Make it yours." |
| **Fragment rhythm** | Short declarative punches alternating with analytical depth | "That's a feature." followed by a 30-word explanation |
| **Dry self-awareness** | Humor through observation, never performance | "It sounded like a spiritual life coach who accidentally learned Python." |
| **Actionable endings** | Every piece lands on "here's what to do" not "here's what to think" | "Write down the problem. Show it to five people." |

---

## 2. Sentence Patterns

### The Fragment-Declaration Rhythm (Signature Move)
```
This is a thank-you note.
Not a launch.
Not a hot take.
Not a personal victory lap.
```

### The Bridge Sentence (Pivot)
Short, punchy, redirects the reader:
- "That feedback stayed with me."
- "That's the flip most people miss."
- "This isn't prediction. It's already happening."

### Length Variation
Alternate between long analytical (25-40 words) and short punches (3-8 words):
> "For every job AI makes redundant, it also removes a barrier to creating something independently." [LONG]
> "He's right. This is real." [SHORT]

---

## 3. Argument Architecture

Every piece should follow this structure:

1. **Open with a specific reference or data point** (not an opinion)
2. **Acknowledge the obvious interpretation**
3. **Pivot to the non-obvious angle** ("I want to offer a third response")
4. **Support with numbers, not vibes**
5. **Close with an actionable takeaway** (not inspiration)

---

## 4. What Frank SAYS vs. NEVER Says

### Frank Would Say
- "Here's what I built. Here's how. Fork it."
- "The work speaks louder than the marketing."
- "12,000 songs isn't a throwaway stat. It's evidence the system works at scale."
- "The question isn't whether it's real. The question is what you do about it."
- "Start smaller than you think you need to."
- "If the system isn't enjoyable to use, it's not done yet."
- "Take what's useful. Adapt it."
- "2025 separated AI builders from AI talkers."
- "Creation Season starts at midnight."
- "Same DNA: take nothing and turn it into infrastructure."

### Frank Would NEVER Say
- "Unlock your potential!" (self-help)
- "10x your productivity!" (bro marketing)
- "In today's fast-paced world..." (generic)
- "I'm passionate about..." (corporate filler)
- "Let me share my journey..." (vulnerability theater)
- "Just dropped a banger" (try-hard casual)
- "This is going to blow your mind" (hype)
- "Thoughts?" or "Agree?" (lazy engagement bait)
- "Who else feels this?" (parasocial)
- "Link in bio" (influencer-coded)
- "GAME-CHANGING" or "MUST-READ" (caps hype)
- Anything with "unlock", "manifest", "awaken", "soul-aligned"

---

## 5. Humor Style

**DRY. OBSERVATIONAL. SELF-AWARE.**

Good:
- "It sounded like a spiritual life coach who accidentally learned Python." (self-roast)
- "Expensive rubber-ducking." (describing generic AI chat)
- "Even our most sophisticated AI agents couldn't locate this page." (404)
- "A little cringe." (about his old brand language)

Bad (never do):
- Punchline humor
- Self-deprecation for engagement
- Memes or pop culture references
- Sarcasm aimed at others
- "Hot takes" for controversy

---

## 6. The Cool Authority Spectrum

```
Try-hard ←─────────── Frank ──────────→ Disengaged

"GAME-CHANGING!!"     "Here's what works."     *silence*
"You NEED this!"      "Worth knowing."         "..."
"MUST-READ!!"         "Saved you 40 hours."    *gone*
```

Frank sits firmly in the middle. Engaged enough to share consistently. Restrained enough to never feel desperate.

**The formula:**
```
Cool Authority = Deep Expertise + Simple Language + Emotional Restraint + Occasional Humor + Zero Posturing
```

---

## 7. Platform-Specific Rules

### X (Twitter)
- No hashtags (or 1 max)
- Threads: 4-6 tweets ideal, never pad to fill
- Hook tweet: bold specific claim or surprising data point
- Last tweet: link + one dry line, NOT a CTA question
- Fragment rhythm works perfectly here

### LinkedIn
- 1-3 hashtags max (at end, never inline)
- First 2 lines must stop the scroll (before "see more")
- Personal narrative > listicle format
- NEVER end with "Thoughts?" or "What do you think?"
- End with a link or a specific statement, not a question
- Frank has TWO voices: Oracle-Frank (slightly more corporate) and FrankX-Frank (builder voice). Social content uses FrankX-Frank.

### Newsletter
- Subject line: specific, curiosity-driven, under 50 chars
- Preview: one sentence that completes the hook
- Body: 3 paragraphs max. What, why it matters, link.
- Feels like a note from a friend, not a marketing email

---

## 8. Hook Frameworks (Adapted for Frank's Voice)

### The Subverted Expectation (HookPoint)
Take the common belief, flip it:
- NOT: "AI is amazing for productivity!"
- YES: "Most AI productivity advice is expensive rubber-ducking. Here's what actually compounds."

### The Specific Number
Lead with a real, earned number:
- "12,000 songs. 22 skills. 8 agents. Built over 14 months."
- "18 MCP servers. 8 were broken. I didn't know."

### The Quiet Contrarian
State the opposite without drama:
- "Most AI agents are if-else statements with an LLM wrapper."
- "The documentation alone won't make you good at it."

### The Builder's Report
Results + honest process, zero showmanship:
- "Built this to $12K MRR. Took 14 months. Here's what the timeline actually looked like."
- "Intelligence score went from 72 to 93. The trick was 5 safety systems, not more features."

### The "I Spent X So You Don't Have To"
Leverage real effort:
- "I tested 12 orchestration frameworks in production. 9 were overengineered."
- "I debugged 18 MCP servers manually. Then I built a tool to do it in 10 seconds."

## 9. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern | Why It's Wrong | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| "Here's the X-layer architecture:" | Sounds like a course sales page | Just explain it naturally |
| "Not X. Y." dramatic reveal | Overused, feels manufactured | Use fragment rhythm instead |
| Generic CTA questions | "What do you think?" is lazy | End with a link or statement |
| Over-counting ("500+ tracks") | Frank has 12,000+ songs. Use real numbers. | Always use actual stats |
| 5+ hashtags | Looks desperate | 0-3, at the end only |
| Exclamation marks in hooks | Try-hard energy | Periods. Fragments. Calm. |
| "Here's how it works:" | Generic structure announcement | Just... show how it works |
| Every tweet starting with a number | Monotonous | Vary: data, observation, bridge, specific |

---

## 10. Visual Content Strategy

### Image Formats That Work
| Format | Tool | When |
|--------|------|------|
| Chibi/character mascot | ChatGPT/Midjourney/Nano Banana | Brand personality posts, resource lists |
| Dark tech infographic | InfoGenius (futuristic style) | Architecture breakdowns, comparisons |
| Carousel (dark theme) | Canva | Resource lists, step-by-step, "top 10" |
| Screen recording clip | OBS / Opus Pro | Build-in-public, tool demos |
| Code screenshot (dark) | Carbon.sh / VS Code | Technical tips, config examples |

### The Chibi/Character Direction
- ACOS mascot (bear/wolf/fox/kitsune hybrid, 3 tails) as branded chibi
- Character in dark hoodie with FX monogram or tool logos
- Dark premium aesthetic, NOT cute/cartoon (matches brand)
- Use for: social profile pics, resource list hero images, thread headers
- Generate with: "chibi-style figure wearing dark navy hoodie with [BRAND] logo, glowing cyan/purple accents, dark background, collectible figure aesthetic"

### Viral Visual Patterns
- "Top 10 free tools" → carousel with tool logos, one per slide
- "Resource list" → dark grid with icons/logos and one-line descriptions
- "Build-in-public" → actual screenshots with annotations
- "Comparison" → side-by-side dark cards

## 12. The Content Quality Filter

Before publishing, every piece must pass:

1. **Would Frank actually say this?** Read it aloud in his voice.
2. **Is there a real number?** If no specific data, add some or cut the claim.
3. **Does it help someone build?** If it's just motivation, delete it.
4. **Is the ending actionable?** "Here's what to do" not "here's what to feel."
5. **Is the hook earned?** The first line must reflect real experience, not manufactured drama.
6. **Zero try-hard energy?** Remove ALL caps, excessive exclamation marks, "GAME-CHANGING", hype words.
7. **Would it embarrass Frank if a peer read it?** If yes, tone it down.

---

## 13. Key Numbers (Always Use Real Stats)

| Stat | Value | Context |
|------|-------|---------|
| AI songs created | 12,000+ | Not 500. The real number. |
| Blog posts | 85+ | Published on frankx.ai |
| ACOS skills | 22 curated | Not 630 (that was unvetted npm) |
| ACOS agents | 8 real | Not 158 (those were timestamps) |
| Intelligence score | 72→93 | v9.3 to v10 |
| MCP servers debugged | 18→5 | mcp-doctor story |
| Trajectories | 60+ | Session learning data |
