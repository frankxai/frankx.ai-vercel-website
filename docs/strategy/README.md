# Strategy Directory

This directory keeps the FrankX.ai strategic canon explicit and versioned.

- `v1/` captures the historical creator + enterprise mix so we can reference past positioning without keeping it in active circulation.
- `v2/` contains the current Creator-First blueprint, daily operating rules, and agent instructions that every model must follow going forward.

Move any deprecated plans, roadmaps, or audience experiments into `v1/` and author future-facing guidance in `v2/`. Each file should open with purpose, owner, and last-updated date so agents know how fresh the material is.
