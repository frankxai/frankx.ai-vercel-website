- When to use each pattern (decision framework)
- How to implement each pattern (step-by-step)
- What pitfalls to avoid (500+ project experience)
- How to measure success (ROI frameworks)

---

## Pattern 1: Information Retrieval / RAG

### What It Is
AI that retrieves and synthesizes information from your organization's knowledge bases, documents, and data sources.

### The "Ask AI" Classification
This is pure "Ask AI" — user asks, AI retrieves and answers.

### When to Use
- Large document repositories (policies, procedures, manuals)
- Customer support knowledge bases
- Research and analysis workflows
- Internal Q&A systems

### When NOT to Use
- When data is highly dynamic (changes hourly)
- When accuracy must be 100% (legal, medical without review)
- When the knowledge base is poorly organized

## The "Ask AI vs Act AI" Sales Framework

When talking to enterprise prospects, use this simple framework:

### Discovery Questions

1. "Are you trying to help people find information faster, or automate tasks they currently do manually?"
   - Information = Ask AI (Patterns 1-2)
   - Automation = Act AI (Patterns 3-5)

2. "Does this need to just answer questions, or actually take actions in your systems?"
   - Answer = Conversational Agent
   - Actions = Automation Agent

3. "Is this about processing documents, or analyzing data?"
   - Documents = Multi-Modal Processing
   - Data = Analytics & Reports

### Positioning Statement

> "We help organizations implement AI that delivers ROI, not just demos. Our framework covers the 5 core AI design patterns — from information retrieval to autonomous agents — so you choose the right approach for each use case."
