# FrankX Image Style DNA

_The definitive reference for all visual content generation_

## Quick Reference

| Style                  | Background                          | Use For                                   | Quality Bar                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Dark Premium Glass** | Navy #0a0e1a → #0f172a              | Architecture, ecosystem, products, social | PRIMARY — 70% of images     |
| **Da Vinci Codex**     | Parchment/sepia OR dark+gold frames | Research, complete guides, deep systems   | PREMIUM — 15% of images     |
| **Light Workshop**     | White → soft lavender/blue          | Tutorials, workshops, getting-started     | EDUCATIONAL — 15% of images |

## Organic-First Principle

**Every FrankX image must establish organic form before layering technology.**

This is the single most important rule. Before any circuit trace, holographic panel, or chrome surface is added, the image must have a living, organic foundation:

| Element          | Organic First                                                       | Tech Layered On                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Characters**   | Real fur, skin, feathers. Eyes with personality and character       | Circuit traces as veins beneath skin. Glow emanates from within, not bolted on |
| **Environments** | Natural forms — crystalline caves, root networks, canopy structures | Bioluminescent data streams. Holographic panels growing from organic surfaces  |
| **Objects**      | Tactile materials — leather, wood grain, woven fiber, stone         | Glass/chrome accents embedded in organic hosts. Not chrome-dominant            |
| **Compositions** | Living presence — a creature, a hand, roots, growth patterns        | Technology as nervous system, not exoskeleton                                  |

### The Chrome Robot Test

Before approving any prompt or image, ask:

> "Could someone describe this as a 'chrome robot' or 'sterile tech render'?"

If yes — the image fails. Add organic elements until the answer is no.

### Reference: The Gold Standard

`public/images/mascot/mascot-v05-techno-beast-standing.png` — organic first (real fur, animal presence, character in eyes), tech embedded (circuit traces as veins beneath skin, glow from within). This is what every FrankX character should aspire to.

### Anti-Reference: What We're Fixing

Any image where technology is the primary visual and organic elements are absent or token. Chrome robots. Floating geometric shapes in void. Clean metallic surfaces without living presence.

## Quality Scoring (7-Gate Filter)

Every generated image must pass ALL gates before use:

| Gate                   | Question                                     | Fail = Regenerate      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1. Brand Alignment     | Does it match one of the 3 approved styles?  | Mixed or unknown style |
| 2. Color Balance       | Are 3+ accent colors visible (not monotone)? | Single color dominance |
| 3. Information Density | Is every area of the canvas purposeful?      | Large empty spaces     |
| 4. Depth Layers        | Can you identify foreground/mid/background?  | Flat single-plane      |
| 5. Text Legibility     | Are labels readable at 680px blog width?     | Tiny illegible text    |
| 6. Icon Quality        | Are elements rich 3D, not flat clipart?      | Generic flat icons     |
| 7. Scroll-Stop         | Would you pause scrolling on LinkedIn?       | Forgettable            |

### Rating Scale

- **9-10**: Publish immediately (Tier 1: Excellent)
- **7-8**: Good, may improve with iteration (Tier 1B: Excellent aesthetic)
- **5-6**: Regenerate with style-locked prompt (Tier 2: Okay)
- **1-4**: Delete and start over (not in the 3 approved styles)

## Anti-Patterns (What Makes Images "Okay" Instead of "Excellent")

| Anti-Pattern                | Why It Fails                            | Fix                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Generic brain/neural**    | Overused, feels like stock AI imagery   | Use specific 3D objects: glass cubes, holographic panels, chrome gears |
| **Single-color saturation** | Too much purple OR blue without balance | Always use 3+ accent colors                                            |
| **Flat hub-spoke**          | Simple connections without depth        | Add foreground/background layers, glass platforms                      |
| **Clipart icons**           | Destroys premium feel instantly         | Use 3D rendered objects with glass/chrome materials                    |
| **Sparse composition**      | Feels like a slide, not an artwork      | Fill canvas with purposeful detail (Da Vinci fills every inch)         |
| **Mixed style**             | Trying to be both clean AND dense       | Commit to one approved style fully                                     |
| **Light blue monotone**     | "Corporate presentation" energy         | Either go full light-workshop or full dark-premium                     |

## Workflow: Image Generation Pipeline

### Step 1: Classify Content

Before generating, classify the blog post:

- **Architecture/Ecosystem/Product** → Dark Premium Glass
- **Research/Complete Guide/Deep System** → Da Vinci Codex (or Da Vinci Dark)
- **Tutorial/Workshop/Getting Started** → Light Workshop

### Step 2: Select Sub-Variant

For Dark Premium Glass, choose:

- C1 Cyberpunk Neon → comparisons, roadmaps, coding
- C2 Da Vinci Dark → ecosystem, flagship content
- C3 Cinematic Studio → music, creative tools
- C4 Holographic Command → AI orchestration, vision

### Step 3: Generate 4 Variations

Always generate 4 versions of the same prompt with slight variations.
Cost: ~$0.04-0.16 total (negligible).

### Step 4: Score & Select

Apply the 7-Gate Filter. Pick the highest scorer.
If none score 7+, refine the prompt and regenerate.

### Step 5: Log Prompt

Save the winning prompt to `data/image-generation-log.json` for future reference.

## Cost / ROI Analysis

### Current Costs

| Model                  | Cost/Image  | Quality            |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash Image | ~$0.01-0.04 | Good (7-8/10)      |
| Gemini 3 Pro Image     | ~$0.04-0.10 | Excellent (8-9/10) |
| DALL-E 3 (OpenAI)      | ~$0.04-0.12 | Excellent (8-9/10) |

### Regeneration Budget

- 8 "okay" images × 4 variations × $0.04 = **$1.28**
- Blog posts without heroes (~55) × 4 variations × $0.04 = **$8.80**
- **Total to upgrade entire blog: ~$10**

### ROI

- Professional hero images increase blog CTR **30-50%**
- Consistent visual brand increases recognition and trust
- Better social sharing (images are #1 factor in social engagement)
- **ROI is effectively infinite at this cost**
