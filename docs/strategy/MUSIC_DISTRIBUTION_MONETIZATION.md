| **Landing pages** | Background audio player or hero embed | Featured player component |
| **About/Team** | Signature track as identity element | Small embed in sidebar |
| **Arcanea pages** | Arcanean Choir playlist, Lumina, Arcanea (light me up) | Full playlist section |
| **Email sequences** | Link to tracks as "listen while you read" | CTA button to Suno |

### 1B. Specific Content-Track Pairings

|---------------------|----------------------|-----|

| **Vibe OS product** | Vibe O S | Literal theme song |
| **About page** | The Awakening | Personal, consciousness theme |
| **Coaching/courses** | Trust in Yourself | Motivational, highest like ratio |
