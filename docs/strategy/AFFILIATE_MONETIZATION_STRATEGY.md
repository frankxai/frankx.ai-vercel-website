RAILWAY_AFFILIATE_ID=xxx
N8N_AFFILIATE_ID=xxx
BETTERSTACK_AFFILIATE_ID=xxx
VERCEL_V0_AFFILIATE_ID=xxx
POLAR_STORE_ID=xxx
```

### URL Patterns (to be updated with actual IDs):
- Railway: `https://railway.app/template/[TEMPLATE_ID]?referralCode=[AFFILIATE_ID]`
- n8n: `https://n8n.io/?ref=[AFFILIATE_ID]` (PartnerStack tracked)
- Better Stack: `https://betterstack.com/?ref=[AFFILIATE_ID]`
