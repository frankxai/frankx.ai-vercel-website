## About Page (/about)

### Hero

**Headline:** "The Builder's Son"

### Story Sections

**Section 1: Origin**
```
I grew up renovating houses with my dad. Volga-German family—my parents came to Germany as refugees, started with nothing, built everything brick by brick.

My dad had this thing he'd say: "Each day we make some. We make something prettier."

That stuck with me.
```

**Section 2: The Journey**
```
After high school, I went to Australia for a year—needed to see what else was out there. Then Magdeburg for my master's, then Amsterdam. Now I live in IJburg, finally by the water. Beach runs in the morning. Ocean access. That matters to me.
```

**Section 3: The Day Job**
```
By day, I'm an AI architect. Enterprise stuff—banking systems, healthcare platforms, manufacturing intelligence. The kind of projects where if the system breaks, someone's losing real money.

I've learned a lot about what actually works at scale versus what looks good in demos.
```

**Section 4: The Night Creator**
```
My best work happens in the hours between midnight and 3:30 AM.

That's when the world gets quiet. No Slack. No meetings. Just me and the possibility space. That's when the music happens. That's when the frameworks crystallize. That's when the mythology writes itself.

I've made hundreds of songs using AI. I've built an entire mythology called Arcanea—nine Guardians, constructed languages, cosmic hierarchies. I do breathwork, cold exposure, beach runs at dawn.
```

**Section 5: The Synthesis**
```
Most people have one or two of these: technical depth, aesthetic sense, creative practice, business architecture, narrative capacity.

I have all five. That's not bragging—it's recognizing a responsibility. This combination is rare. If I don't build from this intersection, it doesn't get built.
```

### What I Believe (can be sidebar or separate section)

- Everyone deserves their own AI Center of Excellence
- AI should amplify your humanity, not replace it
- The best creative work happens when you stop fighting your nature
- We're living in the Golden Age of creation

## Systems Page (/systems)

### Hero

**Headline:** "The Seven Intelligence Systems"
**Subheadline:** "Frameworks for personal development. Infrastructure for scale."

### Core Distinction

**Two columns or cards:**

| Intelligent Systems (IS) | Operating Systems (OS) |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Frameworks & knowledge systems | Infrastructure & automation |
| For personal domains & development | For execution & scale |
| Guide how you think & grow | Run your operations |

### System Cards

Display each system as a card:

**Intelligent Systems:**

| System | Code | Purpose | Icon suggestion |
|--------|------|---------|-----------------|
| Student IS | SIS | Personal growth, learning | 📚 or graduation cap |
| Family IS | FIS | Generational knowledge, family legacy | 🏠 or tree |
| Creator IS | CIS | Content creation, creative work | ✨ or paintbrush |
| Teacher IS | TIS | Education, curriculum design | 🎓 or lightbulb |
| Starlight IS | STIS | Systems thinking, long-term vision | ⭐ or galaxy |

**Operating Systems:**

## Vibe OS Page (/vibe-os)

### Hero

**Headline:** "Vibe OS"
**Subheadline:** "When you're vibing, the universe conspires to make creation effortless."

### Philosophy Section

```
Vibe OS is the connector layer. It sits on top of all the other systems and ties them together through music, emotion, and flow states.

The idea: when you're in flow, creation becomes effortless. Music can trigger flow. Intention shapes what you create. So instead of fighting your state, you design for it.
```

### Principles (4 cards)

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Flow-first | Everything designed to induce and maintain creative flow |
| Creator-centered | AI amplifies human potential, doesn't replace it |
| Music-triggered | Generative music aligned with emotional intention |
| Agent-orchestrated | Digital workers serving your creative vision |

### What It Connects

Visual showing Vibe OS connecting:
- AI Architect Academy
- AI Music Academy  
- GenCreator OS
- Life Blueprint framework

## AI Architect Academy Page (/academy)

### Hero

**Headline:** "AI Architect Academy"
**Subheadline:** "Enterprise AI demystified. For professionals who want to go deep."

- Consultants who need to advise on AI
- Leaders making AI decisions
- Anyone transitioning into AI architecture

### What You Learn
