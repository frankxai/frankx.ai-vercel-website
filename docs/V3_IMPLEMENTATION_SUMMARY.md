## üìä Using EmailCapture Component

The component is reusable across your site:

```tsx
import EmailCapture from '@/components/EmailCapture'

// Basic usage
<EmailCapture />

// Custom for specific product
<EmailCapture
  product="intelligence-systems"
  placeholder="Get the Intelligence Pack"
  buttonText="Send Me the Pack"
/>

// For Vibe OS
<EmailCapture
  product="vibe-os"
  placeholder="Join Vibe OS Waitlist"
  buttonText="Get Early Access"
/>
```

### Where to Add Email Capture

## üîß Database Migration (Later)

Current: Simple JSON file (`data/subscribers.json`)

**When you're ready to scale:**
1. Set up Vercel Postgres or Supabase
2. Replace file operations in `/app/api/subscribe/route.ts`
3. Keep the same API interface (seamless migration)

**Supabase Schema (for future):**
```sql
create table subscribers (
  id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
  email text unique not null,
  name text,
  product text default 'general',
  subscribed_at timestamp default now()
);
```

## üêõ Known Issues & Considerations

### Build Performance
- Build times are long (~2min) due to content generation scripts
- Consider optimizing prebuild scripts or moving to build-time generation

### Data Storage
- JSON file storage is MVP-only
- Will need database when scaling past ~100 subscribers
- File writes may not work on Vercel serverless (use Vercel KV as interim)

### Email Deliverability
- Verify domain in Resend for production
- Set up SPF, DKIM records
- Monitor delivery rates

### Video Performance
- Large videos impact page load
- Consider lazy loading or poster-only on mobile
- Use CDN for video hosting if file is large
