## Pricing Psychology

### Why $19/mo Works

**Price Anchoring**:

- Suno AI Pro: $30/mo (just music generation)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo (general AI)
- Claude Pro: $20/mo (general AI)

**Vibe Club value**: $19/mo for specialized music agents + multi-LLM + monthly pack = **better than all three**.

**Willingness to Pay**:

- $19/mo = _impulse purchase_ territory (Netflix, Spotify tier)
- No lengthy consideration — "just try it for a month"
- Annual option ($199/yr) = 2 months free (12% choose annual)

### Why $97/mo for Pro

- **3x higher than Club** but **10x more value** (API access, custom agents, team seats)
- Positioned below $297 advanced courses (clear upgrade path)
- Agencies bill clients $150-300/hour — $97/mo is negligible expense

### Why BYOK Custom Pricing

- High variance in usage (10k vs. 1M API calls/month)
- Enterprise budgets require formal proposals
- SLA guarantees justify premium pricing
- White-label adds 2-3x multiplier
