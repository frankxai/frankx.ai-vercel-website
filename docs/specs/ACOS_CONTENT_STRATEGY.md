## Content Inventory: What Already Exists

| Article | Date | Status | Gap Analysis |
|---------|------|--------|--------------|
| `agentic-creator-os.mdx` | 2025-09-18 | Published | Needs v6 update, lacks technical depth |
| `getting-started-agentic-creator-os.mdx` | 2026-01-21 | Published | Good setup guide, needs MCP details |
| `30-minute-creator-os-quick-start.mdx` | 2026-01-22 | Published | Quick start, limited scope |
| `agentic-workflows-save-hours.mdx` | Published | Published | Workflow focus, no swarm content |
| `creator-intelligence-systems-2026.mdx` | 2026-01 | Published | Broad, needs ACOS specifics |

**Gap**: No deep-dive on Swarm Intelligence, Use Cases by Creator Type, MCP Integration, Skill Building, Enterprise Deployment, or SEO/AEO optimization.
