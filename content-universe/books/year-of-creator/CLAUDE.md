## 🚫 AI Writing Patterns to Avoid

### Forbidden Phrases

- "Let's dive into"
- "It's important to note that"
- "Interestingly enough"
- "At the end of the day"
- "Moving forward"
- "With that being said"

### Weak Patterns
- Starting too many sentences with "However," "Moreover," "Furthermore"
- Overusing colons and semicolons
- Three-item lists in every paragraph
- Predictable paragraph structures
- Generic conclusions that summarize instead of inspire

### Excellence Standards
- Sentences that surprise and delight
- Unexpected metaphors and connections
- Specific details over generalizations
- Stories that show instead of explanations that tell
- Natural conversation flow, not academic dissertation
