## 📝 Chapter Writing Checklist

### Before Writing
- [ ] Review outline and previous chapter
- [ ] Gather research and case studies
- [ ] Identify the transformation promise
- [ ] Choose opening story/hook
- [ ] Define key takeaways

### During Writing
- [ ] Start with compelling scene, not explanation
- [ ] Use specific details (names, numbers, places)
- [ ] Show transformation through story
- [ ] Include dialogue and human moments
- [ ] Build tension and resolution

### After Writing
- [ ] Remove these AI patterns:
  - [ ] "In today's world" openings
  - [ ] Triple-item lists in every section
  - [ ] Overuse of moreover/furthermore
  - [ ] Generic conclusions
  - [ ] Abstract language without concrete examples
- [ ] Verify factual claims are marked for checking
- [ ] Ensure exercises are specific and doable
- [ ] Check reading level (aim for 8th-10th grade)
- [ ] Confirm transformation delivered

- Transformation exercises: 40+

## 🔁 Iteration Protocol

### When Stuck on AI Patterns:
1. Read sentence aloud - does it sound human?
2. Would a friend say this in conversation?
3. Can you make it more specific?
4. Can you show it through action/dialogue?
5. Can you surprise the reader?

### When Lacking Impact:
1. What specific action can reader take?
2. How will they measure success?
3. What's the smallest viable step?
4. What resistance will they face?
5. How do we overcome it?

### When Missing Emotion:
1. Add sensory details (sight, sound, touch)
2. Include human moments of doubt/triumph
3. Use metaphors from reader's world
4. Share vulnerable truths
5. Celebrate small wins

## 💾 Backup and Version Control

### After Each Session:
- Save all files with date stamps
- Create backup in cloud storage
- Note major changes in log
- Track word count progress

### Weekly:
- Full backup of entire project
- Review and refine outline
- Assess pace and adjust
- Celebrate progress
