## Specific Revisions

### 1. Section IV: Lines 97-98 — Remove Announcement

**Current:**
> Let me tell you what is happening in the world while you wrestle with your calling.

**Revised:**
> Something is happening in the world while you wrestle with your calling.

*Reason: "Let me tell you" is announcement. Just show.*

### 2. Section IV: Lines 107-109 — Update Creator Economy Stats

**Current:**
> The creator economy reached $205 billion in 2024. It will approach half a trillion by 2027. These are not just numbers—they are the sound of gates falling, walls crumbling, roads opening that never existed before.

**Revised:**
> The creator economy crossed $250 billion in 2025. By 2027, it will reach half a trillion dollars. These are not just numbers—they are the sound of gates falling, walls crumbling, roads opening that never existed before.

### 3. Section IV: Lines 109-112 — Update Creator Numbers

> Full-time digital creators in America: 200,000 in 2020. 1.5 million in 2024. A sevenfold multiplication in four years.
>
> Two million creators worldwide now earn their living through their creation. Two hundred million more are building toward that possibility.

**Revised:**
> In America alone, 45 million people now create professionally. Another 117 million create while building toward that possibility.
>

### 4. Section IV: Lines 115-118 — Strengthen AI Section

**Current:**
> And then—artificial intelligence arrived.
>
> What once required a team of ten now requires one human and their AI collaborators. What once took months now takes days. What once demanded expertise now demands only vision. The distance between "I wish this existed" and "I built this" has collapsed from years to hours.

**Revised:**
> Then came the agents.
>
> Not tools that assist, but teammates that execute. Ninety-one percent of professional creators now partner with AI to scale what once required teams. What took months takes days. What demanded expertise now demands vision. The distance between "I wish this existed" and "I built this" has collapsed from years to hours.

### 5. Section V: Lines 132-159 — Tighten "Honoring All Paths"

This section makes an important point but takes too long to make it. Consider condensing from 27 lines to 18-20 lines.

**Specific cuts:**
- Lines 137-140 (redundant examples)
- Lines 143-144 ("And this is sacred" + context already established)
