```

## Framework Design Principles

### Memorability
- **Acronyms**: CREATE, IMPACT, LAUNCH (meaningful backronyms)
- **Alliteration**: The 4 P's, The 5 C's
- **Numbers**: 7-step method, 3 core principles
- **Metaphors**: Journey, blueprint, system, engine

### Clarity
- Each step is a specific action, not a concept
- Order is logical and necessary
- No skippable steps
- Clear entry and exit points

### Actionability
- Every framework step has concrete actions
- Resources needed are listed
- Time required is specified
- Success looks like [specific outcome]

### Scalability
- Works for beginners and advanced users
- Can be completed in stages
- Allows for iteration
- Grows with the user

## Mental Model Design

### Characteristics of Sticky Mental Models
- **Visual**: Can be drawn or diagrammed
- **Metaphorical**: Maps to familiar concept
- **Simplifying**: Makes complex → simple
- **Actionable**: Guides decisions
- **Memorable**: Easy to recall and apply

### Examples
```
The Creator Flywheel
- Create → Publish → Learn → Improve → Create (better)
- Visual: Actual flywheel gaining momentum
- Application: Content creation process

The AI Amplifier Framework
- Human Input → AI Processing → Human Curation → Output
- Visual: Amplifier/multiplier diagram
- Application: AI-assisted workflows

The Three Cs of Content
- Compelling (hooks attention)
- Clear (easy to understand)
- Connected (emotionally resonant)
- Visual: Triangle with examples at each point
```

## Behavior Change Integration

### Leverage Points
1. **Habit Stacking**: Attach new behavior to existing habit
2. **Environment Design**: Make desired action easiest path
3. **Social Accountability**: Built-in sharing/community
4. **Progress Visibility**: Clear markers of advancement
5. **Quick Wins**: Early successes build momentum

### Implementation Intentions
Format: "When [SITUATION], I will [ACTION]"

Example:
- When I sit down to write, I will use the Hook-Story-Framework structure
- When I finish a blog post, I will extract 3 social threads
- When I get stuck, I will use the [SPECIFIC FRAMEWORK]
