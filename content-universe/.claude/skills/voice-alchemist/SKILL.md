## Prose Enhancement Framework

### Sentence-Level Improvements

**Weak → Strong Verbs**
- ❌ "is doing" → ✅ "transforms"
- ❌ "has been shown to" → ✅ "proves"
- ❌ "are able to" → ✅ "can"
- ❌ "make use of" → ✅ "use"

**Generic → Specific Details**
- ❌ "many people" → ✅ "47% of creators" or "thousands of musicians"
- ❌ "significant impact" → ✅ "doubled their income"
- ❌ "various ways" → ✅ "through three distinct methods"

**Abstract → Concrete Imagery**
- ❌ "The future of work is changing" → ✅ "LinkedIn profiles gather dust while Patreon pages thrive"
- ❌ "AI is democratizing creation" → ✅ "A teacher in Ohio publishes her first album using Suno"

### Paragraph-Level Improvements

**Rhythm Variation**
```
Bad rhythm (monotonous):
AI is transforming work. It's changing how we create. It's reshaping industries.

Good rhythm (varied):
AI transforms work. Not gradually—violently. The resume dies while the creator emerges.
```

**White Space Strategy**

- Use single-sentence paragraphs for impact
- Create breathing room for complex ideas
- Strategic paragraph breaks for emphasis
