## Usage
```
/course-module ai-music-academy 3 "Advanced Suno AI Techniques"
```

## What This Does

Creates a transformative learning module:

1. **Course Architect** designs module structure and learning path
2. **Literary Architect** creates engaging learning journey narrative
3. **Truth Weaver** sources examples, case studies, resources
4. **Impact Engineer** designs exercises, projects, assessments
5. **Voice Alchemist** scripts lesson content
6. **Publishing Pipeline** formats for LMS platform
7. **Content Repurposer** creates blog posts from lessons

## Output

You'll receive:

### Module Structure
- **Module Overview**: Objectives, duration, prerequisites
- **4-7 Lessons**: Each 10-15 minutes with micro-objectives
- **2-3 Exercises**: Practical applications with examples
- **1 Module Project**: Comprehensive demonstration
- **Assessment**: Quiz + rubric for project evaluation
- **Resources**: Tools, templates, additional readings

### Each Lesson Includes
- Learning objective
- Video script (if filming)
- Text lesson content
- Examples and demonstrations
- Action step
- Discussion prompt

### Additional Deliverables
- **Blog Posts**: 1 per lesson (for marketing)
- **Social Threads**: Module highlights

## Quality Standards

✓ Progressive complexity (beginner → advanced)
✓ Actionable outcomes (students create real work)
✓ Engagement design (varied formats, interactive)
✓ Transformation focus (measurable skill gain)
✓ Support systems (community, resources, troubleshooting)

## What Happens Next

The module will be saved to:
`content-universe/courses/<course>/modules/module-<num>-<slug>/`

With structure:
```
module-3-advanced-techniques/
├── module-overview.md
├── lessons/
│   ├── lesson-1.md
│   ├── lesson-2.md
│   └── [...]
├── exercises/
│   ├── exercise-1.md
│   └── exercise-2.md
├── project/
│   ├── project-brief.md
│   └── rubric.md
├── assessment/
│   └── quiz.json
└── resources/
    ├── templates/
    └── readings.md
```

You can then:
1. Upload to LMS (Thinkific, Teachable, custom)
2. Film video lessons
3. Launch as cohort or self-paced
