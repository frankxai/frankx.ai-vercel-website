# Write Chapter

Create a complete book chapter using the full Content Universe agent team.

## Parameters
- `<book>` - Book name (e.g., "year-of-creator")
- `<chapter-num>` - Chapter number
- `[topic]` - Optional: Chapter topic/title

## Usage
```
/write-chapter year-of-creator 6 "The Music Revolution"
```

## What This Does

Orchestrates a complete chapter creation workflow:

1. **Content Universe Oracle** analyzes the request and coordinates all agents
2. **Literary Architect** designs chapter structure with three-act arc
3. **Truth Weaver** gathers case studies, statistics, and sources
4. **Voice Alchemist** crafts beautiful, AI-pattern-free prose
5. **Impact Engineer** adds frameworks, exercises, and transformation elements
6. **Publishing Pipeline** runs quality gates before saving
7. **Content Repurposer** identifies blog post extraction opportunities
8. **Knowledge Graph** updates with new chapter and relationships

## Output

You'll receive:
- Complete chapter draft (3000-5000 words)
- Source citations and verification notes
- Quality gate report
- Suggested blog post extractions (3-5)
- Social thread ideas
- Knowledge graph update

## What Happens Next

The chapter will be saved to:
`content-universe/books/<book>/chapters/chapter-<num>-<slug>.md`

And you can:
1. Review and refine with `/enhance-prose`
2. Extract blog posts with `/repurpose`
3. Publish when ready with `/publish`

**Time estimate**: 15-20 minutes for full chapter creation with all quality gates.
