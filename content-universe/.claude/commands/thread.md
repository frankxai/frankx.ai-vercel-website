# Thread

Create a viral Twitter/X thread ready to post.

## Parameters
- `<topic>` - Thread topic
- `[source]` - Optional: Source content to repurpose from

## Usage
```
/thread "Suno AI democratizing music production"
/thread "AI Music" blog-042
```

## What This Does

Creates a high-engagement Twitter/X thread:

1. **Social Media Strategist** designs thread structure and hooks
2. **Literary Architect** (if original) creates narrative arc
3. **Content Repurposer** (if from source) extracts and adapts
4. **Voice Alchemist** ensures punchy, scroll-stopping language
5. **Publishing Pipeline** formats for Twitter (280 char limit)

## Output

You'll receive:
- Complete thread (8-12 tweets numbered)
- 3 hook variations to A/B test
- Engagement strategy (when to post, how to engage)
- LinkedIn version (expanded for platform)
- Instagram carousel idea (10 slides)
- Posting time recommendation

## Thread Structure

Your thread will include:
- **Tweet 1**: Irresistible hook
- **Tweet 2**: Why this matters
- **Tweets 3-10**: Key insights (numbered)
- **Tweet 11**: Common mistake to avoid
- **Tweet 12**: CTA (engagement question + follow ask)

## Virality Engineering

Each thread is optimized for:
- **Pattern Interrupt**: Stops the scroll
- **Curiosity Gap**: Creates desire to read more
- **Value**: Every tweet teaches something
- **Shareability**: Insights people want to share
- **Engagement**: Ends with question/discussion

## What Happens Next

The thread will be saved to:
`content-universe/social/threads/<slug>.md`

And you can:
1. Copy-paste directly to Twitter
2. Schedule with Buffer/Hootsuite
3. Post and engage in first hour (critical for algorithm)

**Time estimate**: 5-10 minutes for complete thread with variations.
