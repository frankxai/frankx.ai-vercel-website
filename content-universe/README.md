# FrankX Content Universe

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: Production Ready

> A superintelligent content creation system that transforms individual pieces into a compound-value universe through AI-powered agents, cross-format repurposing, and strategic orchestration.

---

## 🌌 What This Is

The **Content Universe** is your complete content creation ecosystem that:

- **Creates** all content types (books, blogs, courses, social) with specialized AI agents
- **Connects** content across formats through knowledge graph tracking
- **Compounds** value by systematically repurposing high-performers
- **Coordinates** 10 specialized agents for quality and consistency
- **Automates** quality gates, publishing, and distribution

### The Big Idea

**Every piece of content is an asset that can compound in value.**

A blog post becomes a book chapter. That chapter becomes a course module. The course generates blog posts for SEO. Those blogs become social threads. The threads drive traffic back to the course. The cycle continues, building on itself.

This is content as a **universe**, not a collection.

## 📊 Knowledge Graph & Cross-Pollination

### How Content Connects

The knowledge graph tracks relationships:

```json
{
  "blog-042": {
    "title": "AI Music Production for Non-Musicians",
    "type": "blog-post",
    "themes": ["ai-music-production", "creator-economy"],
    "repurposedTo": ["chapter-5", "module-005", "thread-089"],
    "relatedTo": ["blog-038", "blog-051"],
    "performance": {
      "views": 5200,
      "shares": 320,
      "status": "high-performer"
    }
  }
}
```

### Cross-Pollination Rules

From `content-config.json`:

**Blog → Book Chapter**:
- Trigger: 1000+ shares, 100+ comments
- Action: Auto-suggest expansion to chapter
- Approval: Required before creating

**Book Chapter → Course Module**:
- Trigger: Has actionable frameworks + exercises
- Trigger: Length > 3000 words
- Action: Auto-suggest course module
- Approval: Required

**Any → Social**:
- Trigger: Content published
- Action: Auto-generate thread + LinkedIn version
- Approval: Not required (review before posting)

### Using the Graph

```bash
# Link related content
/link-content blog-042.md chapter-5.md repurposed-to

# See all relationships
/theme-map creator-economy

# Check content status and opportunities
/content-status
```

### Content Not Meeting Quality Gates

```bash
# Run quality checks individually:
/remove-ai-patterns <file> report   # See what needs fixing
/verify-claims <file>                # Check facts
/impact-check <file> strict          # Assess actionability

# Fix issues, then run auto-enhance:
/enhance-prose <file>                # Voice Alchemist polish
```

### Can't Find Content in Graph

```bash
# Rebuild knowledge graph connections:
/link-content <file1> <file2> <relationship>

# View full theme map:
/theme-map

# Check content status:
/content-status
```

### Publishing Fails

```bash
# Check quality gate report
/publish <file> <platform>

# Fix blocking issues shown in report
# Re-run publish
```

## 🌟 Best Practices

### 1. Start with Research

Before creating, research with `/research <topic>`

Gather:
- Case studies
- Statistics
- Expert perspectives
- Verification sources

### 2. Use Templates

Don't start from blank page. Use templates:
- Faster creation
- Consistent structure
- Quality built-in

### 3. Link Everything

As you create, link related content:
```bash
/link-content <new> <related> related
/link-content <source> <repurposed> repurposed-to
```

Builds knowledge graph automatically.

### 4. Run Quality Gates

Before publishing, always:
```bash
/remove-ai-patterns <file>
/verify-claims <file>
/impact-check <file>
/enhance-prose <file>
```

Don't skip this. It's what makes content exceptional.

### 5. Repurpose Systematically

Every month:
1. Review performance (`/content-status`)
2. Identify high-performers
3. Repurpose winners to new formats
4. Compound value

### 6. Theme Consistency

Check theme map monthly:
```bash
/theme-map
```

Ensure hitting pillar targets (40/25/20/15%).

### 7. Update Knowledge Graph

After creating, always update:
- Link to related content
- Mark repurposing relationships
- Track performance

The graph makes everything smarter over time.
