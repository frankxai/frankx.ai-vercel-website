2. **NEVER change these values** without explicit user approval
3. **PROPAGATE updates** to all codebases when this file changes
4. **FLAG inconsistencies** when found in the wild
5. **TREAT THIS AS READ-ONLY** unless Frank explicitly says to update it

### Bio (Short - 160 chars for Twitter)
Musician-technologist building AI systems that amplify human creativity. Founder @FrankX_AI • Vibe OS • Suno • Oracle

### Bio (Medium - 1 paragraph)
Frank X. Riemer is a musician-technologist who bridges systems thinking, creativity, and cutting-edge AI. As founder of FrankX.AI, he helps creators build operating systems for their studios using Claude, Suno, and agentic workflows. His work spans AI music production, enterprise intelligence systems, and builder-focused content that turns overwhelmed creators into confident, AI-empowered artists.

### Bio (Long - Full Background)
Frank X. Riemer is a musician, technologist, and creator systems architect who spent the first half of his career as a professional violinist before discovering his calling at the intersection of systems thinking, creativity, and artificial intelligence.

Today, he architects AI systems that amplify human creativity rather than replace it. As the founder of FrankX.AI, he's built Vibe OS (an AI-powered music creation system), the Agentic Creator OS framework, and the Creation Chronicles--a weekly dispatch on agentic AI systems for independent creators.

His work combines deep technical expertise (Oracle, Claude, LangGraph, MCP) with a musician's understanding of flow, ritual, and creative practice. Frank believes we're entering a Golden Age where AI becomes a creative partner, not a replacement, and his mission is to help creators navigate this shift with confidence and purpose intact.

When he's not building systems or writing essays, you'll find him in the studio creating compelling soundscapes with Suno, or exploring the intersection of creative practice and modern technology through his builder frameworks.
