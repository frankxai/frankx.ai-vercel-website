## Module 1: Prompt Engineering Library

### **Core Prompt Categories**

#### üéØ **Flow State Optimization Prompts**
```
Flow State Foundation Prompt:
"Create a binaural beat-enhanced ambient track at 40Hz gamma frequency, incorporating subtle rhythmic elements that sync with optimal cognitive processing cycles. The music should build gradually over 8 minutes, maintaining consistent energy without jarring transitions. Include natural sound elements (flowing water, gentle wind) layered beneath electronic tones. Optimize for deep focus work sessions with minimal vocal distractions."

Productivity Enhancement Prompt:
"Generate an instrumental track designed for goal achievement and task completion. Use motivational chord progressions in D major, incorporate subtle percussion that matches optimal work rhythm (60-70 BPM base with 120-140 BPM overlay). Include gradual energy builds every 4 minutes to combat attention fatigue. No lyrics, minimal melodic complexity to avoid cognitive overload."
```

#### üé® **Genre-Specific Professional Prompts**
```
Cinematic Productivity:
"Create an epic orchestral piece with Hans Zimmer-style build-ups, perfect for creative work sessions. Begin with solo piano, gradually add strings, brass, and subtle electronic elements. Use the Circle of Fifths progression for emotional impact. 8-minute duration with three distinct movement phases."

Tech Startup Ambient:
"Produce a futuristic ambient track with subtle glitch elements and warm analog synthesizers. Incorporate field recordings of keyboard typing and coffee shop ambiance at 15% volume. Use pentatonic scales in A minor for non-distracting melodic content. Perfect for coding sessions and strategic planning."
```

#### üöÄ **Commercial-Ready Templates**
```
Podcast Intro/Outro:
"Create a 30-second podcast intro with professional broadcast quality. Include space for voiceover announcement, subtle brand-building melody, and clean fade points. Use premium sound design elements with broadcasting compression. Make it memorable but not overpowering."

Social Media Content:
"Generate 15, 30, and 60-second versions of an engaging background track for Instagram Reels and TikTok. Include modern trap-influenced beats, catchy melodic hooks, and strategic energy peaks for maximum engagement. Optimize for mobile phone speakers."
```
