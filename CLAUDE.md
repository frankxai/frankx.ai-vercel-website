## Content Creation Guidelines
- **Voice:** Personal, honest, generous. "I'm Frank" not "We are FrankX"
- **Tone:** Real experiments, real techniques, no BS. Creative-first, technical credibility second.
- **Claims:** Only say what's verifiably true. 500+ songs? Yes. 12K community? Only if real.
- **Focus:** My transformation journey with generative AI. Suno music, agentic experiments, creative automation.
- **Structure:** "Here's what I'm learning..." → "Exact technique..." → "Try it yourself (free)"
- **NO:** Spiritual language, false claims, corporate speak, sales pressure

## Collaboration Protocol
1. Align with `docs/strategy/v2/CREATOR-FIRST-BLUEPRINT.md` before writing.
2. Draft inside the relevant pod (`docs/pods/*`) when possible for quick review.
3. Leave implementation notes for Codex/Gemini if components or analytics are required.
4. After publish, log highlights + metrics questions in `docs/DAILY_INTELLIGENCE_OPERATIONS.md`.

## ? Success Metrics
- Creator testimonials and case studies captured each week.
- Conversion lifts on creator funnels (toolkit, Vibe OS, Realm).
- Engagement on essays + music drops.
- Consistent Frank voice across channels.
