## Content Creation Guidelines
- **Voice:** cinematic, intimate, rooted in studio life.
- **Cadence:** every deliverable points to a ritual or release (download, session, Realm).
- **Structure:** lead with feeling, clarify the system, close with a concrete next action.
- **Proof:** highlight creator case studies; remove enterprise jargon.

## Collaboration Protocol
1. Align with `docs/strategy/v2/CREATOR-FIRST-BLUEPRINT.md` before writing.
2. Draft inside the relevant pod (`docs/pods/*`) when possible for quick review.
3. Leave implementation notes for Codex/Gemini if components or analytics are required.
4. After publish, log highlights + metrics questions in `docs/DAILY_INTELLIGENCE_OPERATIONS.md`.

## ? Success Metrics
- Creator testimonials and case studies captured each week.
- Conversion lifts on creator funnels (toolkit, Vibe OS, Realm).
- Engagement on essays + music drops.
- Consistent Frank voice across channels.
