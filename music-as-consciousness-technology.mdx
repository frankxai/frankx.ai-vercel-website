# 12,000 Songs Later: What AI Music Taught Me About Creative Systems

*Three years of daily creation. What emerged wasn't what I expected.*

---

## TL;DR

Music shifts brain states. Specific frequencies create specific effects—40Hz for focus, 7Hz for meditation. After 12,000+ songs with [Suno AI](https://suno.com), the real insight: collaboration beats generation. Treat AI output as a first draft, iterate 5-10 times, bring your emotional truth. AI handles the technical; you provide the creative direction.

## How It Started

2 AM. Studio lights on. I stumbled into Suno thinking I'd make a few tracks for fun.

That was three years and 12,000+ songs ago.

Somewhere around song 3,000, the nature of the work changed. I stopped making music. Started using music as a tool for something else entirely.

## What 12,000 Songs Reveal

### Pattern Recognition

I thought I'd explore every genre. Didn't happen. Kept returning to the same themes—connection, transformation, the space where technology meets something deeper.

AI became a mirror. It showed me what I actually cared about, not what I thought I cared about. The songs that hit weren't planned. They surprised me with their emotional truth.

### Collaboration vs. Generation

The slot machine approach—type a prompt, hope for magic—produces noise. Collaboration produces resonance.

What works:
- Start with a specific emotion or memory
- Treat AI output as a first draft
- Iterate 5-10 times on a single concept
- Edit lyrics, curate selections, add your touch

### Music as State Technology

Different frequencies, different effects. Research on [brainwave entrainment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5818683/) backs this up:

| Frequency | State | Application |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 40 Hz (Gamma) | Focus, insight | Deep work sessions |
| 10 Hz (Alpha) | Relaxed awareness | Creative ideation |
| 7 Hz (Theta) | Flow, meditation | Emotional processing |
| 4 Hz (Delta) | Deep rest | Recovery |

Understanding this shifted everything. Music stopped being entertainment. Became a tool.

I now design [Vibe OS](/products/vibe-os) sessions—audio experiences engineered for specific states. Not mysticism. Applied neuroscience.

## The Deeper Layer

After 12,000 songs, the insight wasn't about AI.

It was about creativity as a system.

Music accesses what language can't—what neuroscientist [Antonio Damasio](https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-What-Happens-Emotion-Consciousness/dp/0156010755) calls "the feeling of what happens." AI handles the technical production. That frees you to focus on the emotional work.

The songs that moved people weren't technically superior. They were emotionally true.

## The Process

### Step 1: Choose Your Target State (5 min)
Not "I want a sad song."
More like: "That specific quiet after a long conversation ends."

### Step 2: Craft the Prompt (10 min)
Include: emotion + genre + instrumentation + atmosphere

*Example: "Cinematic ambient, contemplative, sparse piano with reverb, warm analog synths, intimate and vast—like watching sunset alone on a mountaintop"*

### Step 3: Iterate (30-45 min)
Generate three variations. Pick the closest. Refine what's missing. Repeat until it resonates. Usually takes 5-10 rounds.

### Step 4: Sit With It (20 min)
Listen without distraction. Notice what surfaces. Consider how you'll use the piece.

## Applications

**Processing emotions**: Create from a specific feeling. Let AI reflect it back. Iterate until it clicks. Use the result as an anchor.

**Creative flow**: Design playlists for your work. Match frequencies to tasks. Create transition tracks between modes. More detail in my [Suno production workflow](/blog/suno-music-production-workflow).

**Integration work**: Process difficult experiences through sound. Create pieces for life transitions. Build your personal support library.

## The Invitation

You don't need 12,000 songs. You need one.

Pick an emotion. Write a prompt. Generate and iterate until something resonates. Sit with what emerges.

The tools are here. The question is whether you're ready to listen.

## FAQ

### What is Suno AI?
[Suno](https://suno.com) generates full songs from text prompts—lyrics, melody, production, mixing. You focus on creative direction; it handles execution.

### How do you write a good prompt?
Start specific. Not "dance music" but "nostalgic synthwave about reconnecting after years apart." Emotion + genre + instrumentation + vibe.

### What frequencies work for focus?
40 Hz (Gamma). Research associates it with enhanced concentration. Listen for 20-30 minutes before deep work.

### How many iterations?
Best results come from 5-10. Each one teaches you what's missing.

### Can you sell AI-generated music?
Yes, with proper licensing. Check Suno's current terms. Many creators release commercially.

### Is AI music "real" music?
Music is defined by its effect, not its production method. If it moves you, it's real.
