### **EMAIL 1: INSTANT DELIVERY + QUICK WIN**
**Subject:** [INSIDE] Your Flow State Frequency Guide + Something Unexpected

**Copy:**

Hey [First Name],

Most productivity advice is backwards.

They tell you to "just focus harder" or "eliminate distractions."

But here's what they don't tell you: Your brain literally can't sustain focus without the right environmental triggers.

That's why I spent $50,000 and 3 years researching the frequency patterns that put your mind into effortless flow states.

**Your Flow State Frequency Guide is attached** – but first, I want you to try something right now:

🎧 **[CLICK TO PLAY: 3-Minute Flow Sample]**

Put on headphones. Hit play. Notice what happens to your mind in the first 60 seconds.

Most people tell me they feel their shoulders drop and their racing thoughts slow down almost immediately.

The science behind this is fascinating (and I break it all down in your guide), but the short version is this:

Your brain is constantly pattern-matching. When it hears specific frequency combinations, it automatically shifts into the neural state associated with deep work.

I discovered this by accident after losing $2.4M on a failed startup – a story I'll share with you tomorrow.

But today, just try the sample. Let me know what you experience.

Reading your guide now? Here's your quick-start protocol:

1. Find a work task you've been procrastinating on
2. Put on the audio sample (link above)
3. Set a timer for 25 minutes
4. Start working without forcing it

Most people are shocked by how effortless focus becomes.

Talk soon,
Frank

P.S. Tomorrow I'll tell you about Sarah, a marketing agency owner who used these principles to increase her revenue by 340% in 8 weeks. Her story changed everything I thought I knew about productivity.

### **EMAIL 2: SOCIAL PROOF + DEPTH**
**Subject:** Sarah's revenue jumped 340% in 8 weeks (here's how)

**Copy:**

[First Name],

Sarah thought she was broken.

Despite running a successful marketing agency, she'd hit a wall. Working 70-hour weeks but seeing flat revenue. Constantly scattered. Starting projects but never finishing them.

"I felt like my brain was in a fog," she told me. "I knew what I needed to do, but I couldn't focus long enough to actually do it."

Sound familiar?

Here's what changed everything for Sarah...

She started using strategic audio environments to trigger flow states on command.

**Month 1:** She implemented the frequency protocols from your guide
**Month 2:** Her team noticed she was "different" – calmer but more decisive
**Month 3:** She closed her biggest client ever ($45K retainer)
**Month 8:** Revenue up 340%, working 20% fewer hours

But here's the part that really matters:

Sarah isn't special. She's not naturally more focused than you. She just learned to work WITH her brain instead of against it.

**The Science Behind Sarah's Transformation:**

Your brain operates on predictable patterns. When it encounters specific frequency combinations:

✓ Alpha waves increase (associated with creative problem-solving)
✓ Beta wave spikes decrease (less mental chatter)
✓ Dopamine production optimizes (sustained motivation)
✓ Cortisol levels stabilize (reduced stress response)

Sarah simply learned to trigger these states intentionally.

**Did you try yesterday's 3-minute flow sample?**

If yes – you experienced this firsthand. If not, here it is again:
**[3-Minute Flow State Audio Sample]**

Most people notice the effect within 60 seconds. Your mind just... settles.

But here's where it gets interesting...

That sample represents about 0.1% of what's possible when you have access to the complete system.

Tomorrow, I'll share the story of how I discovered this – and why it cost me $2.4M to learn these lessons the hard way.

Stay tuned,
Frank

P.S. Sarah actually created her own signature "focus soundtrack" using advanced AI principles. It's become her secret weapon for high-stakes client presentations. I'll show you how she did it later this week.

### **EMAIL 3: AUTHORITY BUILDING + VULNERABILITY**
**Subject:** The $2.4M mistake that led to this discovery

**Copy:**

[First Name],

I need to tell you about my biggest failure.

2019. I was running a SaaS company that was "crushing it" on paper.

$2.4M in funding. Amazing team. Revolutionary product.

But I was drowning.

16-hour days. Constant context switching. My brain felt like a browser with 47 tabs open – all of them frozen.

**The moment everything changed:**

3 AM. Another sleepless night staring at spreadsheets. My co-founder Sarah walks into the office, takes one look at me, and says:

"Frank, you're the bottleneck. And you're going to kill this company."

She was right.

**I was trying to solve a hardware problem with software solutions.**

All the productivity apps, time-blocking systems, and "focus techniques" in the world couldn't fix the fundamental issue:

My environment was actively fighting my brain's natural ability to focus.

The office was chaos. Fluorescent lights. Open floor plan. Constant interruptions. Random music choices that made concentration impossible.

**Six months later, we lost everything.**

Not because the product was bad. Not because the market wasn't there.

Because I literally couldn't think clearly long enough to make the decisions that mattered.

**But here's where it gets interesting...**

That failure launched a 3-year obsession with the neuroscience of focus.

I spent $50K on research. Interviewed 200+ high performers. Studied everything from monastery acoustics to NASA productivity protocols.

**The breakthrough came from an unexpected place:**

Music producers.

These guys routinely enter 8-hour flow states. They create complex, beautiful work that requires sustained creative focus.

How?

They understand something the rest of us don't: **Audio architecture.**

They design sonic environments that literally rewire their brains for peak performance.

**I reverse-engineered their methods.**

Combined them with cutting-edge neuroscience research.

Added AI to make it accessible to anyone.

The result? The system Sarah used to increase her revenue 340%. The same system that helped me rebuild my career and create the FrankX.AI platform you know today.

**Tomorrow, I'll introduce you to Marcus.**

A Fortune 500 executive who was spending $5K/month on custom productivity coaching.

Until he discovered this system.

His transformation will probably surprise you.

Stay focused,
Frank

### **DAY 4: PROBLEM AGITATION**
**Subject:** Why your brain fights productivity (and how to win)

**Copy:**

[First Name],

Your brain is sabotaging your success.

Not on purpose. It's actually trying to protect you.

But the modern work environment triggers ancient survival mechanisms that make sustained focus nearly impossible.

**Here's what's happening in your head right now:**

🧠 **The Vigilance System:** Your brain constantly scans for threats. Open offices, notification sounds, even background conversations trigger micro-stress responses that fragment your attention.

🧠 **The Novelty Bias:** Every new stimulus (email ping, Slack message, random thought) releases a tiny hit of dopamine. Your brain becomes addicted to these interruptions.

🧠 **The Effort Paradox:** The harder you try to focus, the more your brain resists. It's like trying to fall asleep by forcing yourself to sleep.

**This is why willpower alone fails 97% of the time.**

You're fighting millions of years of evolution with conscious effort. Evolution always wins.

**But here's the secret high performers know:**

Instead of fighting your brain, you can redesign your environment to make focus effortless.

Think about it:

- Why can you binge-watch Netflix for 6 hours straight?
- Why do some restaurants make you want to linger while others make you want to leave?
- Why does your favorite coffee shop feel more productive than your office?

**Environmental design.**

**The most successful people don't have more willpower – they have better environments.**

Marcus (Fortune 500 executive) discovered this after burning out twice in three years.

Sarah (marketing agency owner) learned it after hitting a revenue plateau that nearly killed her business.

I figured it out after losing $2.4M because I couldn't think clearly enough to run my company.

**The common thread?**

We all learned to work WITH our brains instead of against them.

**Tomorrow, I'll show you exactly how Marcus did it.**

And why he fired his $5K/month productivity coach after discovering this system.

Hint: It wasn't because he didn't need help anymore. It was because he found something that worked better.

Talk soon,
Frank

### **DAY 6: AUTHORITY DEMONSTRATION**
**Subject:** How I helped a Fortune 500 CEO find his flow

**Copy:**

[First Name],

"I feel like I'm losing my mind."

That's the first thing Marcus told me when we met.

Here's a guy who runs a $2B division. 500+ employees. Board meetings with billionaires.

But he couldn't concentrate for more than 12 minutes without his attention fragmenting.

**Marcus was trapped in the "Success Paradox":**

The more successful he became, the more his environment worked against his ability to think clearly.

Corner office with floor-to-ceiling windows (constant visual distractions).
Open-door policy (interruptions every 3.7 minutes on average).
Back-to-back meetings (no mental reset time).
"Productivity" playlist on Spotify (random songs that spike cortisol).

He was spending $5K/month on executive coaching. $15K on productivity consultants. $8K on the latest "focus enhancement" technology.

Nothing worked.

**Because they were all treating the symptoms, not the cause.**

**The real problem? Environmental chaos.**

Marcus's brain was in constant "threat detection" mode. Every visual stimulus, audio cue, and interruption triggered micro-stress responses that made deep thinking impossible.

**Here's what we changed:**

✅ **Audio Architecture:** Replaced random music with scientifically-designed frequency patterns that induce flow states

✅ **Visual Optimization:** Strategic lighting and visual field management to reduce cognitive load

✅ **Interruption Protocols:** Specific time blocks with environmental cues that signal "do not disturb" to his nervous system

✅ **Transition Rituals:** Audio-based reset protocols between different types of work

**The results were immediate:**

**Week 1:** Focus sessions extended from 12 minutes to 45 minutes
**Week 3:** Completed his most important strategic project in 18 months
**Week 6:** Team noticed he was "different" – calmer but more decisive
**Week 12:** Promoted to CEO, crediting his "newfound clarity"

**But here's my favorite part:**

Marcus didn't just transform his own performance. He implemented these principles across his entire organization.

**Company-wide results:**
- 34% increase in project completion rates
- 52% reduction in meetings (people could focus and get things done)
- 67% improvement in employee satisfaction scores
- $2.3M in productivity gains (measured over 6 months)

**Marcus fired his $5K/month productivity coach.**

Not because he didn't need help. But because he'd found something that actually worked.

"Frank," he told me, "this isn't productivity coaching. This is cognitive architecture. It's like upgrading the operating system of my brain."

**The methodology Marcus used is exactly what Sarah used to increase her revenue 340%.**

It's the same system that helped me rebuild after my $2.4M failure.

And it's the foundation of everything I'm going to show you this week.

**Tomorrow: The science behind why this works so well.**

And why most productivity advice is not just useless – it's actually counterproductive.

Stay sharp,
Frank

P.S. Marcus actually created a custom "executive flow soundtrack" using advanced AI principles. It's now his secret weapon for board presentations and high-stakes negotiations. Later this week, I'll show you the exact system he used.

---

### **DAY 8: OBJECTION HANDLING**
**Subject:** "But I'm not creative..." (and other myths holding you back)

**Copy:**

[First Name],

"But Frank, I'm not creative. I'm an engineer."

That's what David told me when I first mentioned using AI music creation for productivity enhancement.

David runs a fintech startup. Pure logic. Pure data. Zero artistic background.

"Music creation is for artists," he said. "I need spreadsheets and code, not... whatever this is."

**Six months later, David's perspective had completely changed.**

He'd built a custom audio environment that helped him code for 6 straight hours without fatigue.

His team productivity increased 89%.

He closed a Series A round after the most focused pitch presentation of his career.

**What changed? David discovered the truth about "creativity."**

**MYTH #1: "I'm not creative enough for this"**

**Reality:** You're not creating music for artistic expression. You're creating environmental tools for cognitive enhancement.

It's like saying "I'm not creative enough to adjust my thermostat." You're simply optimizing your environment for peak performance.

David doesn't consider himself a musician. But he engineered audio environments that help his brain function at its highest level.

**MYTH #2: "This is too complicated for busy professionals"**

**Reality:** The most successful executives are obsessed with environmental optimization.

Marcus (Fortune 500 CEO) spends 15 minutes each morning designing his audio environment for the day.

"It's like putting on the right clothes for the weather," he says. "Except I'm dressing my mind for peak performance."

**MYTH #3: "I don't have time to learn a new system"**

**Reality:** The time investment pays for itself in the first week.

Sarah's story: "I spent 2 hours learning the system. It saved me 8 hours that same week by eliminating decision fatigue and distraction cycles."

**MYTH #4: "AI music isn't 'real' music"**

**Reality:** You're not entering a Grammy competition. You're optimizing neurological function.

AI allows you to create precisely what your brain needs without years of musical training. It's like having a personal neuroscientist who speaks in frequencies.

**MYTH #5: "My work environment is too chaotic for this"**

**Reality:** Chaotic environments need this most.

The noisier and more distracting your environment, the more powerful these audio tools become. They create a "cognitive bubble" that your brain can retreat into.

**Here's what I want you to understand:**

This isn't about becoming a musician.

It's about becoming an environmental architect for your own mind.

**Think of it like this:**

- You optimize your computer's operating system for better performance
- You organize your workspace for better efficiency
- You choose specific lighting for better mood

**This is simply optimizing your audio environment for better cognition.**

The AI handles the complexity. You just get the results.

**Tomorrow, I'll reveal why I'm limiting access to this system.**

And what happens when you combine AI music creation with strategic productivity protocols.

Spoiler: The results surprised even me.

Stay curious,
Frank

P.S. David (the "non-creative" engineer) now helps other tech executives implement these systems. His favorite quote: "I'm not making art. I'm making tools. Really, really effective tools."

### **DAY 10: SCARCITY INTRODUCTION**
**Subject:** Why I'm limiting Vibe OS to 100 people (and what this means for you)

**Copy:**

[First Name],

I need to be honest with you about something.

When I first developed these flow state audio systems, I planned to scale them to thousands of users immediately.

Big launches. Massive marketing campaigns. Maximum reach.

**But something happened that changed everything.**

The first 50 beta users achieved results so extraordinary that I realized I was dealing with something much more powerful than I'd anticipated.

**Marcus (Fortune 500 CEO):** "This isn't just productivity improvement. It's cognitive transformation."

**Sarah (Agency Owner):** "I feel like I've unlocked a superpower I didn't know I had."

**David (Fintech Founder):** "My entire relationship with work has changed. I'm not fighting my brain anymore."

**The problem? Results this good require support this intensive.**

I'm not talking about basic customer service. I'm talking about:

✅ **Personal flow state optimization** (everyone's brain responds differently)
✅ **Custom audio environment design** (your workspace, your goals, your challenges)
✅ **Implementation troubleshooting** (because environment design is both art and science)
✅ **Advanced technique development** (as you master basics, new possibilities emerge)

**This level of support is impossible at scale.**

I could automate it. Create courses and videos and hope for the best.

But that would be doing you a disservice.

The entrepreneurs, executives, and creators who get extraordinary results aren't just using a system – they're being guided through a transformation.

**So I made a decision that my business advisor called "insane":**

**Limit Vibe OS to 100 people for the first year.**

That's it. 100 total spots.

Not 100 per month. 100 total.

**Here's why this matters for you:**

**✅ You get direct access to me** during your first 90 days
**✅ Small community** means real relationships and accountability
**✅ Intensive support** to ensure you actually get results
**✅ Continuous optimization** based on your specific feedback
**✅ Advanced techniques** developed just for this core group

**But here's the trade-off:**

Once we hit 100 people, that's it. The doors close.

I won't accept applications, take waiting lists, or make exceptions.

**Why?** Because diluting the experience would ruin what makes it work.

**When do the doors open?**

**Thursday morning at 9 AM Eastern.**

I'll send you the complete Vibe OS presentation. You'll see everything:

- The full system demonstration
- Real results from beta users
- Exact pricing and package details
- How to secure your spot

**But I need you to make a commitment right now:**

**If you're even slightly interested, you need to be ready Thursday morning.**

Not "I'll think about it and decide later."
Not "I'll wait and see if spots are still available."

**Ready to make a decision. One way or another.**

**Because here's what I've learned:**

The people who transform their lives are the ones who recognize extraordinary opportunities and act decisively.

The people who stay stuck are the ones who keep waiting for "perfect timing."

**Thursday morning, you'll have everything you need to make an informed decision.**

**The question is: Will you be ready to make it?**

Talk Thursday,
Frank

P.S. One more thing: I'll be sharing the complete story of how this system was developed tomorrow. Including the $50K research investment, the failed experiments, and the breakthrough moment that changed everything.

If you're curious about what you'll actually get access to, tomorrow's email will show you everything.

---

### **LAUNCH EMAIL 3: OBJECTION HANDLING**
**Subject:** "What if I'm not technical enough?" (Your concerns answered)

**Copy:**

[First Name],

Since opening Vibe OS yesterday, I've received dozens of questions.

Let me address the most common concerns directly:

**"What if I'm not technical enough to use this?"**

David (fintech founder) asked the same question. Zero musical background. Barely comfortable with Spotify.

Here's his first creation session: **[2-minute screen recording]**

Watch how simple the process actually is. Point. Click. Generate. Optimize.

**The AI handles the complexity. You just describe what you need.**

"I need audio for deep analytical work."
"I want something energizing but not distracting for team meetings."
"I need to feel confident and calm before presentations."

**Vibe OS translates your intentions into precise audio environments.**

No musical knowledge required.

**"What if I don't have time to learn a new system?"**

Sarah's response: "I spent 2 hours learning Vibe OS. It saved me 8 hours that same week."

**Time investment breakdown:**
- Initial setup: 30 minutes
- First audio creation: 15 minutes
- Learning advanced features: 60 minutes
- **Total: 1 hour 45 minutes**

**Time savings in first week:**
- Eliminated "getting into the zone" transition time: 3 hours
- Reduced distraction cycles: 4 hours
- Faster decision-making during flow states: 3+ hours
- **Total saved: 10+ hours**

**Net gain in week 1: 8+ hours of productivity**

**"What if it doesn't work for my specific type of work?"**

**Beta users include:**
- Software developers (extended coding sessions)
- Sales professionals (confidence enhancement)
- Writers and creators (creative flow optimization)
- Executives (strategic thinking support)
- Researchers (analytical focus improvement)
- Consultants (client interaction preparation)

**Every work type benefits from optimized cognitive states.**

**"What if my work environment is too chaotic?"**

Marcus works in a Fortune 500 corporate environment. Open offices. Constant interruptions. Background noise.

**"Vibe OS doesn't eliminate distractions,"** he says. **"It makes your brain immune to them."**

The audio creates a cognitive bubble that your nervous system can retreat into, regardless of external chaos.

**"What if I can't justify the investment?"**

ROI calculation from actual users:

**Sarah (Agency Owner):** $997 investment → $47K additional revenue in 6 months
**Marcus (Executive):** $1,997 investment → Promotion worth $85K annually
**David (Founder):** $497 investment → 89% team productivity increase

**Average ROI: 2,400% in first year**

**"What if I don't like it?"**

60-day money-back guarantee. Use the system. Track your results. If you don't see measurable cognitive improvement, get a full refund and keep everything.

**No risk. Only upside.**

**"What if the 100 spots fill up before I decide?"**

They will.

**Current status: 41 spots claimed, 59 remaining**
**Time remaining: 48 hours**

**Here's what I know about high performers:**

They don't wait for perfect conditions.
They don't analyze opportunities to death.
**They recognize transformative tools and act decisively.**

**Is Vibe OS transformative? Let the results speak:**

- Marcus: 12 minutes → 3+ hour focus sessions
- Sarah: 340% revenue increase in 8 months
- David: Eliminated chronic procrastination permanently

**The question isn't whether this works.**

**The question is whether you're ready to work at your highest level.**

**[Secure Your Vibe OS Spot - 59 Remaining]**

**Timer: 48 hours and counting**

Ready to upgrade?,
Frank

P.S. Tomorrow: The final call. I'll share one last story about what happens when peak performers get access to this level of cognitive optimization.

Spoiler: The results are extraordinary.

### **LAUNCH EMAIL 4: SOCIAL PROOF SURGE**
**Subject:** Why Marcus chose Vibe OS over hiring a $5K/month producer

**Copy:**

[First Name],

"I was ready to hire a full-time music producer."

That's what Marcus told me last month.

**His logic:** If custom audio environments were this powerful, he needed professional-grade content creation.

**The budget:** $5K/month for a dedicated producer
**Plus:** $15K for studio setup and equipment
**Plus:** $8K for licensing and distribution management

**Total annual investment: $88K**

**Then he discovered Vibe OS.**

**"It's like having a world-class producer, sound engineer, and distribution team in my pocket,"** Marcus said. **"Except it knows exactly what my brain needs."**

**Marcus's productivity transformation in 90 days:**

📈 **Focus duration:** 12 minutes → 180+ minutes average
📈 **Strategic projects completed:** 2 per quarter → 2 per month
📈 **Team meeting efficiency:** 45% improvement (measured by decision velocity)
📈 **Stress levels:** 73% reduction (cortisol testing)
📈 **Revenue impact:** $2.3M in measurable productivity gains

**Marcus's conclusion:** "This isn't just better than hiring a producer. It's better than anything I've ever tried."

**Why Vibe OS beats traditional solutions:**

**vs. Hiring a Producer ($60K/year):**
✅ Available 24/7 (no scheduling)
✅ Knows your specific cognitive patterns
✅ Instant iterations and optimization
✅ Zero ongoing costs after initial investment

**vs. Productivity Coaching ($15K/year):**
✅ Addresses the root cause (environment) not just symptoms
✅ Measurable, repeatable results
✅ Works without willpower or behavior change
✅ Compounds over time automatically

**vs. Focus Apps and Software ($2K/year):**
✅ Actually changes your brain state instead of just blocking distractions
✅ Customizable to your specific work and goals
✅ Creates lasting cognitive improvements
✅ Works in any environment

**But here's what really convinced Marcus:**

**"I can create the perfect audio environment for any situation in under 5 minutes."**

Board presentation next week? Custom confidence-enhancing soundtrack.
Strategic planning session? Problem-solving frequency optimization.
Team building retreat? Collaborative energy enhancement.
Quarterly review preparation? Analytical focus amplification.

**"It's like having superpowers,"** he says. **"Except it's just science."**

**The math is simple:**

**Traditional approach:**
- Producer: $60K/year
- Studio setup: $15K one-time
- Licensing: $8K/year
- **Total 3-year cost: $219K**

**Vibe OS approach:**
- Complete system: $497-$1,997 one-time
- **Total 3-year cost: Under $2K**

**Savings: $217K+**
**Performance improvement: Immeasurable**

**Current availability: 18 spots remaining**
**Time remaining: 24 hours**

**Marcus's advice:** "Don't overthink this. I spent 6 months researching alternatives and almost missed the opportunity entirely. This is the real deal."

**Your 60-day guarantee still applies.**

Try Vibe OS. Track your results. If you don't see Marcus-level transformation in your cognitive performance, get every penny back.

### **LAUNCH EMAIL 5: FINAL CALL**
**Subject:** 6 hours left: Don't let this be your biggest regret

**Copy:**

[First Name],

In 6 hours, this opportunity disappears forever.

But before the timer hits zero, I want to share something personal.

**Two years ago, I had a conversation that changed my perspective on regret.**

I was having lunch with a successful entrepreneur – let's call him Robert. Built and sold three companies. Worth about $50M.

**"What's your biggest regret?"** I asked.

**"The opportunities I didn't take when I knew I should have."**

**Not the failures. Not the mistakes. The opportunities he recognized but didn't act on.**

**"I can remember seven specific moments,"** Robert said. **"Seven times I knew something was extraordinary, but I talked myself out of it. Waited too long. Made excuses."**

**"Those seven decisions cost me about $200M and probably 10 years of progress."**

**Then he said something that stuck with me:**

**"Frank, successful people don't have better opportunities. They just recognize them faster and act more decisively."**

**Today, you're facing one of those moments.**

**You know Vibe OS is extraordinary because:**

✅ You've seen Marcus's transformation (12 minutes → 3+ hour focus sessions)
✅ You've watched Sarah's results (340% revenue increase)
✅ You've seen the actual system demonstration (47-minute workflow)
✅ You understand the science (environmental cognitive optimization)
✅ You've calculated the ROI (average 2,400% first-year return)

**The question isn't whether this works.**

**The question is whether you'll act on what you know.**

**Here's what I know about you:**

You wouldn't have read this far if you weren't serious about peak performance.

You wouldn't have watched the demos if you weren't genuinely interested.

You wouldn't be considering this investment if you weren't ready for transformation.

**So what's holding you back?**

**Fear it won't work for you specifically?** → 60-day money-back guarantee
**Concerned about the time investment?** → 2 hours to learn, 10+ hours saved in week 1
**Worried about technical complexity?** → David (non-technical founder) mastered it in 90 minutes
**Questioning the price?** → Marcus was ready to spend $88K/year on alternatives

**Every logical objection has been addressed.**

**What remains is one simple choice:**

**Act on what you know, or add this to your list of "what-ifs."**

**Current status: 7 spots remaining**
**Time remaining: 6 hours**

**After that, this becomes one of Robert's stories.**

**The opportunity you recognized but didn't take.**

**[Secure Your Final Spot - 7 Remaining]**

**Or don't.**

**But please, don't let this be your biggest regret.**

**[Choose Your Vibe OS Package]**

**6 hours and counting.**

Final call,
Frank

P.S. If you don't join Vibe OS today, I genuinely hope you find another path to cognitive transformation. Your brain deserves to work at its highest level.

But I won't offer this opportunity again.
