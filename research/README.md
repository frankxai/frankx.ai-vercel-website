## Starting Research

Run `/research` in Claude Code to activate the Research Intelligence Orchestrator.

### Commands
- `/research` - Daily intelligence scan across all domains
- `/research [topic]` - Deep dive into specific topic
- `/research publish [topic]` - Transform research into content
- `/research status` - Review current research pipeline

## The Research Council

Five specialized agents collaborate on research:

1. **Frontier Scout** - AI & Technology tracking
2. **Depth Diver** - Consciousness & spirituality exploration
3. **Pattern Mapper** - Personal development frameworks
4. **Synthesis Oracle** - Cross-domain connections
5. **Publication Architect** - Content & SEO optimization

## Research Standards

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Multiple sources cross-referenced
- [ ] Claims verified across sources
- [ ] Recency noted (AI moves fast!)
- [ ] FrankX relevance identified
- [ ] Actionable insights extracted
- [ ] Publication potential assessed

### Output Requirements
- **First Principles**: Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- **Creator Lens**: How does this help creators?
- **Practical Bias**: Actionable over academic
- **Frank's Voice**: Accessible expertise

## Integration

Research flows into the FrankX content pipeline:

```
Research → /research publish → /factory → frankx.ai/blog
```

See `.claude/commands/research.md` for the full workflow specification.
