## How to Use This Guide

Each prompt below is the actual text (or reconstructed equivalent) I used in Suno to create my top-performing tracks. For each one, I break down:

- **The prompt** -- copy it directly into Suno
- **Why it works** -- the specific elements that make it produce good output
- **Variations** -- tweak these parameters to explore different directions

Paste these into Suno's "Song Description" field. Set the model to v4 or higher for best results.

## 1. The Awakening (142 plays, 20 likes)

**Genre**: African / World / Cinematic

### The Prompt

```
African, 10 female vocalists, drums, powerful, cinematic, consciousness,
natural, world music, tribal drums, layered female choir, call and response,
dramatic build, soul-stirring, rhythmic percussion, organic, raw energy
```

### Why It Works

- **"10 female vocalists"** -- Suno interprets this as dense layered vocals, creating a rich choral texture
- **"Call and response"** -- triggers an antiphonal structure (lead voice, then group response)
- **"Dramatic build"** -- signals song structure: quiet start → powerful climax
- **"Tribal drums"** -- produces organic percussion patterns instead of electronic beats

### Variations to Try

- Swap "African" for "Mongolian" or "Celtic" for different world music flavors
- Replace "10 female vocalists" with "male baritone choir" for a deeper register
- Add "432Hz" or "528Hz" for healing frequency tuning

## 2. Vibe O S (128 plays, 24 likes)

**Genre**: Hip Hop / Bass

### The Prompt

```
Female hip hop, bass-heavy, lyrical, sophisticated, violin, electric guitar,
808 sub bass, confident female vocalist, clever wordplay, cinematic strings,
modern trap production, polished, radio-ready, 4 minutes
```

### Why It Works

- **"Sophisticated"** -- one of the most powerful Suno keywords. It elevates vocabulary, melody complexity, and production quality
- **"Violin" + "electric guitar"** -- hybrid instrumentation creates a unique sound that blends classical with modern
- **"Bass-heavy" + "808 sub bass"** -- double emphasis ensures deep low-end presence
- **"4 minutes"** -- explicitly requesting longer duration (default is ~2 min)

### Variations to Try

- Replace "female" with "male" or "duet" for different vocal arrangements
- Add "jazz chords" or "neo-soul" for a smoother feel
- Swap "trap production" for "boom bap" for classic hip hop texture

## 3. Golden Age of Intelligence (119 plays, 20 likes)

**Genre**: EDM / Metalcore / Hip Hop

### The Prompt

```
EDM hit, metalcore, sophisticated hip hop, female duet, electric guitar,
festival anthem, massive drop, stadium energy, heavy breakdown, soaring
vocals, electronic meets metal, high production value, radio edit
```

### Why It Works

- **Genre fusion** -- combining 3 genres ("EDM hit, metalcore, sophisticated hip hop") forces Suno into creative territory. Most producers use one genre. Fusing three creates something original.
- **"Female duet"** -- produces vocal interplay: harmonies, call-and-response, and complementary ranges
- **"Massive drop" + "heavy breakdown"** -- structural keywords that give the song a clear peak moment
- **"Festival anthem" + "stadium energy"** -- these context words set the scale and ambition of the production

### Variations to Try

- Replace "metalcore" with "orchestral" for an epic cinematic crossover
- Add "with choir" for additional vocal layers
- Swap "female duet" for "male and female vocal battle" for aggressive energy

## 4. Lumina (108 plays, 16 likes)

**Genre**: Rock / Soul / Orchestral

### The Prompt

```
Arcanean rock, female choir soul, violins, high energy soul, Dolby Atmos
remastered, cinematic, orchestral, natural, dramatic, sophisticated,
uplifting epic feminine beauty extraordinary high notes, cinematic choir,
head voice dramatic soprano vocal mastery, female vocals
```

### Why It Works

- **"Dolby Atmos remastered"** -- this is a production quality keyword. Suno doesn't literally do Atmos, but it signals "premium, wide, immersive" mixing
- **"Head voice dramatic soprano vocal mastery"** -- stacking vocal descriptors forces the AI to generate technically impressive singing
- **"Uplifting epic feminine beauty extraordinary high notes"** -- long descriptive chains let you paint the exact emotional arc you want
- **"Arcanean rock"** -- invented genre terms push Suno into creative interpretation rather than copying existing styles

### Variations to Try

- Replace "Arcanean" with any invented word to create your own genre
- Add "IMAX, THX" as additional production quality signals
- Try "male tenor" or "countertenor" to keep the high vocal range but change gender

## 5. Trust in Yourself (77 plays, 34 likes -- highest like ratio)

**Genre**: Pop Punk / Symphonic

### The Prompt

```
Pop punk, symphonic, male vocals, female chorus, heavy 808 bass, electric
guitar solo, motivational, anthemic, sing-along chorus, energetic,
uplifting message, stadium rock meets pop punk, powerful drums
```

### Why It Works

- **"Male vocals, female chorus"** -- the contrast between a male lead and female backing creates commercial-sounding production
- **"Sing-along chorus"** -- directly tells Suno to make the chorus catchy and repetitive (high memorability)
- **"Stadium rock meets pop punk"** -- genre fusion creates something that feels both massive and personal
- **"Motivational, anthemic, uplifting message"** -- emotional direction words shape the lyric content

### Variations to Try

- Swap "pop punk" for "emo" or "post-hardcore" for darker energy
- Replace "male vocals" with "gender-neutral" for a unique vocal quality
- Add "acoustic bridge" for a quiet moment before the final chorus

## Prompt Engineering Cheat Sheet

### Power Words (use these to level up any prompt)

| Category       | Keywords                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Quality**    | sophisticated, polished, radio-ready, high production value, remastered   |
| **Emotion**    | dramatic, uplifting, haunting, euphoric, melancholic, triumphant          |
| **Structure**  | build, drop, breakdown, bridge, outro, verse-chorus-verse                 |
| **Vocals**     | belting, head voice, whisper, choir, layered harmonies, call and response |
| **Production** | Dolby Atmos, THX, cinematic, spatial, wide stereo                         |

### Common Mistakes

1. **Too vague**: "Make a good song" -- gives Suno no direction
2. **Too short**: Single-word genres produce generic results. Stack descriptors.
3. **Contradictions**: "Calm, aggressive" confuses the model. Pick one emotional direction per section.
4. **Ignoring duration**: Default is ~2 min. Add "3 minutes" or "4 minutes" for longer tracks.
