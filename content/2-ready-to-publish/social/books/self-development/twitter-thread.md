# Twitter Thread: The Art of Self-Development

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
Most self-development books give you one pillar: mindset, or habits, or money, or health.

I identified seven. And the order matters.

Energy. Mind. Soul. Craft. Capital. Circle. Legacy. Here is why:

## Tweet 2 (Context)
Energy comes first because without it, every other pillar collapses.

Your brain processes 11 million bits of sensory data per second. Your conscious mind handles about 50.

The first 90 minutes of your day set the neurochemistry for the next 14 hours. Most people give that window to their phone.

## Tweet 3 (Insight - Craft)
Talent is common. Craft is rare.

Talent opens the door. Craft builds the house. Most people quit at 1,000 hours of practice -- right when the initial excitement fades and the long middle begins.

The long middle is where the craftsman is separated from the hobbyist.

## Tweet 4 (Insight - Capital)
A person who earns $50,000 and saves 40% will achieve financial freedom faster than a person who earns $200,000 and saves 5%.

This is not intuition. This is arithmetic. The savings rate is the most important number in personal finance. Not income. Not returns.

## Tweet 5 (Insight - Legacy)
The question at the end is not "How much did I earn?" or "How many people knew my name?"

The question is: Did I use what I was given?

Legacy is not about being remembered. It is about being used up. Fully. Completely. Nothing left in the tank.

## Tweet 6 (Insight - Integration)
The seven pillars are not separate projects. They are one system.

Energy fuels the Mind. Mind directs the Craft. Craft generates Capital. Capital buys time for the Circle. Circle sustains the Soul. Soul defines the Legacy.

Break one pillar and the structure tilts.

Energy is not motivation. Motivation is a feeling. Energy is a resource.

Like money, it can be earned, spent, invested, and wasted. Unlike money, it regenerates -- but only if you understand how.

I wrote a chapter on this. It changed my mornings permanently.
