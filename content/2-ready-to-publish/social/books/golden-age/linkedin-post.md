# LinkedIn Post: The Golden Age of Creators

## Full Post

The creator economy reached $250 billion in 2025. By 2027, analysts project $500 billion. 207 million people worldwide now create professionally or are building toward it.

But here is the number that stopped me: 91% of professional creators now partner with AI to scale what once required teams.

I wrote The Golden Age of Creators to document a transformation happening at a speed that few people have processed:

The old model required high fixed costs -- studio space, equipment, team salaries. Narrow margins. Required scale to survive.

The new model requires near-zero fixed costs. A laptop, internet, AI subscriptions. Wide margins. Sustainable at individual scale.

The inversion explains the explosion. But it also reveals a new challenge. The bottleneck is no longer capability. Everyone has access to the same AI tools. The bottleneck is judgment.

Three things I wrote about that I think matter most to anyone in professional services:

1. Orchestration intelligence is the new competitive advantage. Gartner reported a 1,445% surge in multi-agent system inquiries from Q1 2024 to Q2 2025. The solo professional who learns to conduct multiple AI specialists operates at a scale that required agencies a decade ago.

2. Taste cannot be automated. AI generates at scale. Dozens of options in seconds. The differentiating skill is knowing what is excellent versus what merely looks excellent. This requires cultivated judgment, not more prompting.

3. The accessibility revolution is real. 34% of new professional creators come from demographics historically underrepresented in creative industries. Geography, wealth, credentials, native language -- these barriers are eroding. The golden age is about who gets to participate, not just how much gets produced.

The book is five chapters. Free to read. No email gate.
