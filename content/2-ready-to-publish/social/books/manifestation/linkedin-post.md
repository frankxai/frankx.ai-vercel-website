# LinkedIn Post: Manifestation

## Full Post

Hotel workers in a Harvard study were told their physical labor exceeded recommended fitness guidelines. They lost weight, lowered blood pressure, and reduced body fat -- without changing their actual activity.

Their expectations about their bodies changed their bodies. This is from David Robson's "The Expectation Effect," which documents decades of research showing that beliefs shape physical reality through measurable biological mechanisms.

I wrote Manifestation because I was frustrated by the gap between what popular culture claims about this topic and what the research actually shows.

The book is not about wishful thinking. It is about three mechanisms that are well-documented in neuroscience and psychology:

1. The Reticular Activating System. Your brain processes 11 million bits of sensory data per second. You consciously experience about 50. The RAS determines which 50 bits reach your awareness based on what you have told it to prioritize. When you set a clear, emotionally charged intention, you are programming a filter. You do not attract opportunities. You notice them.

2. The Identity Layer. Beneath every outcome is a behavior, beneath every behavior is a belief, and beneath every belief is an identity. The person who identifies as "bad with money" will unconsciously avoid financial education and sabotage opportunities -- not out of weakness, but because the brain protects existing identity structures. Change the identity, and the beliefs, behaviors, and outcomes follow.

3. Aligned Action. The manifestation industry has a blind spot the size of a continent: work. The book's chapter on aligned action distinguishes between hustle (action driven by fear of falling behind) and alignment (action driven by clarity about what needs to happen next). Both produce output. One burns out in years. The other sustains for decades.

The framework is practical: audit your current thought patterns, design new blueprints in present tense, collect evidence that supports them, and take action that is coherent with your vision.

Not magic. Architecture.

What belief about yourself has most shaped your professional trajectory -- for better or worse?
