# Instagram Post: Love & Poetry

## Caption

Six languages. Eight chapters. Centuries of poets trying to describe the same thing.

I wrote a book collecting the greatest love poetry ever written -- Rumi, Rilke, Goethe, Neruda, Mary Oliver, Hafiz, Vietnamese poets -- woven with original verse written from lived experience.

In Vietnamese, the word for "missing someone" is the same word for "remember." Some languages understand what others only approximate.
