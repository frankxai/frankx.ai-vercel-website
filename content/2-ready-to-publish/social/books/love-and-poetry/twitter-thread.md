# Twitter Thread: Love & Poetry

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
Rilke asked a question 120 years ago that no one has answered: "How shall I hold my soul so that it does not touch yours?"

I wrote a book about the poets who tried. Eight chapters. Six languages. One truth.

## Tweet 2 (Context)
Here's what I found collecting love poetry across German, Vietnamese, Persian, Spanish, and English:

The same emotion sounds completely different in each language. And somehow, it means exactly the same thing.

## Tweet 3 (Insight - Rumi)
Rumi, 800 years ago: "Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along."

Love does not begin. It is recognized. The meeting is not the start. It is the remembering.

## Tweet 4 (Insight - German)
Erich Fried's "Was es ist" is the most honest poem about love ever written.

Reason argues. Pride scoffs. Experience shakes its head. And Love simply says: "Es ist was es ist." It is what it is.

Love does not argue back. It outlasts every objection.

## Tweet 5 (Insight - Vietnamese)
In Vietnamese, the word for "missing someone" -- nho -- is the same word for "remember."

To miss someone is to remember them. To remember is to keep them alive inside you. The language understands what English separates.

## Tweet 6 (Insight - Neruda)
Neruda wrote: "I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where."

Young love shouts. Mature love whispers. Neruda's revolution was refusing spectacle -- discovering that the deepest love sounds like a quiet statement of fact.

## Tweet 7 (Original Poems)
I wrote original poems in the book too. One called "Two Languages" is about the third language my wife and I invented -- no words, never mistranslates.

When you say something in German that sounds too hard for what you mean, and she hears the softness underneath.

## Standalone Tweet
Rilke's "Liebes-Lied" is a confession dressed as a question: How do I keep my soul separate from yours?

The answer is that you cannot. Once love has tuned two souls to the same frequency, there is no untuning. There is only the music.
