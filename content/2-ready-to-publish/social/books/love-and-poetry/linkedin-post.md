# LinkedIn Post: Love & Poetry

## Full Post

I spent months collecting love poetry across six languages. Not as an academic exercise. As an investigation into whether love sounds different depending on where you are born.

Here is what I found:

Rilke asked in German how to hold his soul so it does not touch the soul of the person he loves. The answer, he knew, is that you cannot. The poem is a confession dressed as a question.

Xuan Dieu wrote in Vietnamese that to love is to die a little inside -- because the wave does not crash against the shore expecting the shore to crash back. It crashes because that is what waves do.

Neruda wrote in Spanish that bread does not nourish him, dawn disrupts him, and all day he hunts for the liquid measure of her steps. He placed love among the necessities, the way hunger demonstrates the importance of food.

And in Vietnamese, the word for "missing someone" is the same word for "remember." The language refuses to separate the two.

The book I wrote from this research -- Love and Poetry -- spans Rumi, Rilke, Goethe, Neruda, Mary Oliver, Hafiz, Vietnamese love poetry, and original verse. Eight chapters. Centuries of voices. One truth repeated in every language: love does not care about your plans.

I also wrote original poems in the collection. One is about the third language my wife and I invented after eight years together -- one that has no words and never mistranslates.

The book is free to read in full on my site. Not because the work has no value. Because some things are meant to be given away.

What is the most powerful line of poetry you have ever encountered?
