# Twitter Thread: ACOS v10 — Autonomous Intelligence

## Tweet 1 (Hook)

I built an AI operating system that improves itself every session.

Intelligence score: 72 → 93 out of 100.

5 new safety systems prevent it from breaking itself.

22 skills. 8 agents. 6 access-controlled profiles.

Here's how it works:

## Tweet 2 (Problem)

The hardest problem in agentic AI isn't making it smart.

It's preventing smart systems from modifying their own config and making themselves dumber.

ACOS v9.3 could learn. But it couldn't validate whether what it learned was actually an improvement.

---

## Tweet 3 (Solution Overview)

v10 adds 5 systems that solve this:

1. Experience Replay — remembers what worked
2. Agent IAM — least-privilege access control
3. Immutable Audit Trail — every action logged
4. Circuit Breaker — stops cascading failures
5. Self-Modify Gate — auto-reverts bad changes

Each one is simple. Together they're powerful.

## Tweet 4 (Experience Replay)

Experience Replay is the simplest upgrade with the biggest impact.

Every session generates a trajectory — tools used, order, outcome.

When you start a new task, the system finds the 2 most similar past successes and injects them as context.

60+ trajectories. 67% avg success rate. Getting better.

---

## Tweet 5 (Agent IAM)

Before v10, every agent could touch every file.

Music producer editing system configs. Content writer running bash commands. Not ideal.

Agent IAM scopes each of 6 profiles to exactly the tools and directories they need.

Least-privilege for AI agents. Same principle as enterprise security.

---

## Tweet 6 (Circuit Breaker)

The most common AI failure mode: trying the same broken approach 8 times, making things worse each time.

Circuit Breaker tracks failures per file:

- 3 failures: warning
- 5 failures: restricted
- 8 failures: full stop

Resets on success or session end. Simple. Effective.

---

## Tweet 7 (Self-Modify Gate)

The most important safety system.

When ACOS modifies its own config:

1. Snapshot current state
2. Apply change
3. Re-score intelligence benchmark
4. If score drops >5 points → automatic rollback

The system can evolve. It can never make itself significantly dumber.

---

## Tweet 8 (Performance)

v10 is also faster.

Hooks reduced from 15 to 7. Per-tool subprocess spawns: 5-6 down to 1-2.

Removed informational-only hooks. Consolidated tracking. Cut PostToolUseFailure overhead.

Less noise. More signal. Better performance on 16GB machines.

---

## Tweet 9 (Honesty)

The honest version: v7 claimed 630+ skills and 158 agents.

An audit revealed 630 were unvetted npm installs. 158 were empty session timestamps.

v8-v10 rebuilt on truth. 22 real skills. 8 real agents. Every number verified.

Better to be honest about 22 than impressive about 630.

---

## Tweet 10 (CTA)

ACOS is open-source and free.

Full breakdown of all 5 systems, the intelligence benchmark, and installation guide:

GitHub: https://github.com/frankxai/agentic-creator-os

Type /acos and describe what you want. The system handles the rest.

# Standalone Tweet (Alternative)

I built an AI system that scores 93/100 on an intelligence benchmark and can modify its own rules — but auto-reverts any change that makes it dumber.

5 safety systems. 22 skills. 8 agents.

## Option 3

"Intelligence score: 72 → 93. Not because we added more. Because we removed what didn't work and validated what did."
