Hi Frank,

Signal Over Hype, Every Week

Intelligence work is about selecting the few signals that change decisions. This week: capability velocity, governance maturity, and the gap between local productivity and system-level performance.

INSIGHTS
1. Capability growth continues to accelerate
The AI Index trajectory reinforces what builders already feel: model capabilities and investment are moving fast, but adoption quality is uneven across organizations and sectors.

2. Policy is converging toward responsible deployment
OECD guidance continues to push trustworthy AI principles into real implementation contexts, especially for public sector and critical use domains.

3. Execution quality remains the bottleneck
Teams with clear value-stream thinking and operational rigor convert AI potential into outcomes. Others stay stuck in pilot mode.

BUILD THIS WEEK
1. Pick one strategic signal and map it to one concrete roadmap decision.
2. Add a risk note to every AI initiative: model, data, workflow, owner.
3. Review one pilot and decide: scale, redesign, or stop.
