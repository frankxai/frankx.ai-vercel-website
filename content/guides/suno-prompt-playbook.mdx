## Part 1: Understanding Suno Prompts

### The Basic Structure

Every Suno prompt consists of three elements:

1. **Style description** - Genre, mood, instrumentation
2. **Lyrics** (optional) - Your words or [Instrumental] tag
3. **Structure tags** - [Verse], [Chorus], [Bridge], etc.

### Style Description Anatomy

```
[Genre] [Subgenre], [Mood], [Instrumentation], [Production style]
```

**Example:**
```
Cinematic orchestral, epic and triumphant, full symphony with choir,
Hans Zimmer style production
```

### What Works vs. What Doesn't

**Effective prompts:**
- Specific genre combinations
- Emotional descriptors (triumphant, melancholic, uplifting)
- Instrumentation details
- Production references

**Avoid:**
- Artist name imitation requests
- Overly complex multi-paragraph descriptions
- Contradictory style elements

## Part 2: Structure Tags

Structure tags tell Suno how to organize your song.

### Core Tags

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| [Intro] | Opening instrumental section |
| [Verse] | Main narrative sections |
| [Chorus] | Repeated hook/refrain |
| [Pre-Chorus] | Build-up before chorus |
| [Bridge] | Contrasting section |
| [Outro] | Ending section |
| [Instrumental] | Music-only section |
| [Break] | Pause or minimal instrumentation |

### Advanced Tags

```
[Drop] - EDM/electronic climax
[Hook] - Catchy melodic phrase
[Spoken] - Speaking rather than singing
[Whisper] - Soft vocal delivery
[Belting] - Powerful vocal performance
```

## Part 3: Genre Deep Dives

### Ambient & Meditation

**Prompt template:**
```

nature sounds, 432 Hz healing frequency, slow tempo, minimal drums
```

**Key elements:**
- Emphasize atmosphere over melody
- Include "healing" or "meditative" descriptors
- Reference specific frequencies (432 Hz, 528 Hz)

### Cinematic & Epic

**Prompt template:**
```
Cinematic orchestral, building tension to triumph, strings section
with brass crescendo, war drums, choir in final section,
film score quality
```

**Key elements:**
- Describe the emotional arc
- Layer instrumentation descriptions
- Reference film score quality

### Electronic & EDM

**Prompt template:**
```

punchy kick drum, side-chain compression, festival main stage energy
```

**Key elements:**

- Describe energy level

### Lo-Fi & Chill

**Prompt template:**
```
Lo-fi hip hop, nostalgic and warm, vinyl crackle, mellow piano chords,
boom bap drums, late night study session vibe
```

**Key elements:**
- Texture descriptors (warm, dusty, hazy)
- Include lo-fi artifacts (vinyl crackle, tape hiss)
- Set a scene or mood

## Part 4: Lyric Formatting

### Basic Structure

```
[Verse 1]
Your first verse lyrics here
Line by line formatting works best
Keep lines relatively short

[Pre-Chorus]
Building anticipation now
Leading to the big moment

[Chorus]
This is your hook right here
The part everyone remembers
Repeat it make them sing along
```

### Pro Tips

1. **Line length matters** - Shorter lines = clearer delivery
2. **Syllable count** - Match syllables to desired rhythm
3. **Rhyme schemes** - Simple patterns work best (ABAB, AABB)
4. **Repetition** - Choruses should have repeatable elements

## Part 5: Building Artistic Identity

### Creating Consistency

To develop a recognizable sound:

1. **Create a style template** - Your go-to prompt base
2. **Document what works** - Keep a prompt journal
3. **Iterate on successes** - Build on winning combinations
4. **Develop signature elements** - Consistent instrumentation or mood

### Example Artist Template

```
Base style: Cinematic ambient electronic, contemplative yet hopeful,
synthesizers and piano with subtle orchestral elements, ethereal
vocals, midnight meditation atmosphere

Variations:
- Add "driving drums" for energy
- Add "solo piano" for intimacy
- Add "full orchestra" for climax
```
