# The Suno AI Prompt Playbook: From First Song to 500+ Track Catalog

**TL;DR:** This guide documents the exact system behind producing 500+ songs with Suno AI. It covers prompt architecture, structure tags, 10 genre-specific production patterns, lyric formatting, artistic identity development, commercial distribution, and the workflows that turn Suno from a toy into a professional production tool.

---

## Why This Guide Exists

Most Suno tutorials show you how to generate a single song. This guide shows you how to build a catalog.

The difference matters. A single AI song is a novelty. A catalog of 50+ intentional, well-produced tracks is a creative asset that generates streaming revenue, provides content soundtracks, establishes artistic identity, and opens opportunities traditional musicians spend years pursuing.

This playbook is based on producing 500+ songs across dozens of genres. Every technique, every prompt pattern, every workflow is tested at scale.

---

## The Suno Production Framework

Professional AI music production follows four phases:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│    1. INTENT — Why this track?         │
│    Define mood, purpose, audience       │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│    2. ARCHITECT — Build the prompt      │
│    Genre, style, structure, lyrics      │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│    3. GENERATE — Produce variations     │
│    Create, evaluate, iterate, extend    │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│    4. PUBLISH — Release to the world    │
│    Master, tag, distribute, promote     │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## Phase 1: Intent — Define Before You Create

Every good song starts with a clear intent. Without it, you're just rolling dice.

### The Intent Checklist

Before writing any prompt, answer:

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| What's the mood? | Drives genre, tempo, instrumentation |
| What's the purpose? | Background music vs. active listening vs. content soundtrack |
| Who's the audience? | Casual listeners vs. genre enthusiasts vs. meditation practitioners |
| What energy level? | Calm (1-3), Moderate (4-6), High (7-10) |
| What's the context? | Morning routine, workout, study, emotional processing, celebration |

### Mood-to-Music Mapping

| Mood | Genre Direction | Tempo | Key Elements |
|------|----------------|-------|-------------|
| Peaceful | Ambient, New Age | 60-80 BPM | Pads, nature sounds, minimal percussion |
| Focused | Lo-fi, Minimal Electronic | 70-90 BPM | Steady beat, warm tones, subtle melody |
| Energetic | EDM, Pop, Rock | 120-150 BPM | Strong drums, driving bass, bright synths |
| Melancholic | Indie, Classical, Dark Ambient | 65-90 BPM | Minor key, piano, strings, space |
| Triumphant | Orchestral, Epic, Anthemic | 100-140 BPM | Brass, choir, building dynamics |
| Romantic | R&B, Jazz, Acoustic | 70-100 BPM | Warm vocals, guitar, intimate production |
| Mysterious | Dark Electronic, Film Score | 80-110 BPM | Dissonance, tension, sparse arrangement |
| Joyful | Pop, Funk, Reggae | 100-130 BPM | Major key, groove, uplifting melody |

## Phase 2: Architect — Building the Prompt

### Prompt Anatomy

Every Suno prompt has three components:

```
1. STYLE DESCRIPTION — Genre + mood + instrumentation + production
2. LYRICS (optional) — Your words with structure tags
3. PARAMETERS — Instrumental toggle, extend options
```

### The Style Description Formula

```
[Primary Genre] [Subgenre], [Mood Descriptors],
[Key Instrumentation], [Production Style],
[Tempo/Energy Reference]
```

**What each element does:**

**Primary Genre** — Sets the foundation. Be specific.
- Bad: "pop music"
- Good: "indie synth-pop"
- Better: "indie synth-pop with 80s new wave influence"

**Subgenre** — Narrows the aesthetic. Combine thoughtfully.
- "Ambient dub techno" (genre + subgenre + subgenre)
- "Cinematic post-rock" (style + genre)
- "Lo-fi jazz hip hop" (aesthetic + genre + genre)

**Mood Descriptors** — Emotional colors. Use 2-3 max.
- "ethereal and contemplative"
- "driving and aggressive"
- "warm and nostalgic"
- "dark and mysterious"

**Instrumentation** — Specific instruments shape the sound.
- "analog synthesizers with warm pad progression"
- "acoustic guitar fingerpicking with light strings"
- "heavy distorted guitars with thundering double bass drums"
- "solo piano with subtle reverb"

**Production Style** — How it should sound technically.
- "clean and polished, radio-ready"
- "lo-fi with vinyl crackle and tape warmth"
- "raw and garage-recorded"
- "orchestral film score quality"
- "minimal and spacious"

## Structure Tags: Deep Reference

Structure tags control your song's arrangement. Mastering them is the difference between a random generation and a professional arrangement.

### Core Structure Tags

| Tag | Function | Best Practice |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| `[Intro]` | Opening section | 4-8 bars, set the mood, no lyrics needed |
| `[Verse]` | Narrative section | Tell the story, lower energy than chorus |
| `[Pre-Chorus]` | Build-up section | Create tension, lead to chorus |
| `[Chorus]` | Hook/refrain | Most memorable part, highest energy |
| `[Bridge]` | Contrast section | Different melody/chords, one per song |
| `[Outro]` | Closing section | Resolve the energy, can fade or end strong |
| `[Instrumental]` | Music-only section | Great for solos, transitions |
| `[Break]` | Minimal section | Strip back to rebuild energy |

### Advanced Tags

| Tag | Function | When to Use |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `[Drop]` | EDM climax | Electronic genres, after build-up |
| `[Hook]` | Catchy phrase | Short, memorable melodic/lyric moment |
| `[Spoken]` | Speech delivery | Intros, interludes, narrative moments |
| `[Whisper]` | Soft delivery | Intimate sections, ASMR-adjacent |
| `[Belting]` | Powerful singing | Emotional climaxes, big moments |
| `[Rap]` | Rhythmic speech | Hip hop sections, verses |
| `[Ad-lib]` | Vocal flourishes | Between phrases, background energy |
| `[Guitar Solo]` | Instrument solo | Specify the instrument |
| `[Fade Out]` | Gradual ending | Classic song endings |
| `[Build]` | Energy increase | Transition into drops/choruses |

### Professional Song Structures

**Standard Pop (3:30)**
```
[Intro] → [Verse 1] → [Pre-Chorus] → [Chorus] →
[Verse 2] → [Pre-Chorus] → [Chorus] →

## Lyric Writing for AI Music

### The Golden Rules

1. **Shorter lines perform better** — 5-8 words per line, clean delivery
2. **Simple rhyme schemes** — ABAB or AABB, not complex internal rhymes
3. **Concrete imagery** — "Neon lights reflecting on wet streets" beats "Life is complex"
4. **Repetition in choruses** — The hook should be immediately singable
5. **Match syllables to tempo** — Fast tempo = fewer syllables per line

### Lyric Template: The Emotion Map

```
[Verse 1] — Set the scene (concrete, visual)
Three images that paint the situation
Each line advances the story slightly
End with a question or tension

[Pre-Chorus] — Build tension (emotional shift)
Short, punchy lines
Rising energy in the words
Point toward the release

[Chorus] — Release the emotion (universal, simple)
The core message in one sentence
Repeat the key phrase
Simple words, big feeling
This is what they remember

[Verse 2] — Deepen the story (new angle)
Same scene, deeper insight
Personal detail that resonates
Progression from verse 1
End pointing back to chorus

[Bridge] — Surprise (different perspective)
Change the rhythm of the words
Say what hasn't been said
The twist or revelation
```

### Example: Complete Lyric with Tags

```
[Verse 1]
City lights blur through the rain
Another midnight walking home again
The silence speaks louder than the crowd
Words I never said out loud

[Pre-Chorus]
But tonight feels different somehow
Standing at the edge of now

[Chorus]
Let it all fall away
Every weight we carry through the day
In the space between the dark and light
We find our way tonight

[Verse 2]
Old photographs in fading frames
We used to set the world in flames
The years move fast but moments stay
Written in the gold of yesterday

[Pre-Chorus]
And something stirs beneath the noise
That quiet undeniable voice

[Chorus]
Let it all fall away
Every weight we carry through the day
In the space between the dark and light
We find our way tonight

[Bridge]
Maybe we were never lost
Just learning what the journey cost
Every scar a story told
Every ending makes us bold

[Chorus]
Let it all fall away
Every weight we carry through the day
In the space between the dark and light
We find our way tonight

[Outro]
We find our way tonight
```

## Building Your Artistic Identity

### The Artist Template System

Your artistic identity is defined by a **base style** with modular variations:

**Step 1: Define Your Base Style**

```
Base: [Your core genre + production aesthetic + emotional tone]

Example: "Cinematic ambient electronic, contemplative and hopeful,
synthesizers and piano with subtle orchestral elements, ethereal
textures, midnight meditation atmosphere"
```

**Step 2: Create Modular Variations**

| Variation | What Changes | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| +Energy | Add "driving drums, uptempo" | Workout, motivation tracks |
| +Intimate | Add "solo piano, minimal, close" | Personal, emotional tracks |
| +Epic | Add "full orchestra, choir, massive" | Album climaxes, trailers |
| +Dark | Add "minor key, dissonant, tension" | Moody, atmospheric tracks |
| +Bright | Add "major key, uplifting, warm" | Positive, morning tracks |

**Step 3: Build a Catalog Template**

For a 10-track album:
1. Opening — Base + Intimate (set the tone)
2. Track 2 — Base (core sound)
3. Track 3 — Base + Energy (build momentum)
4. Track 4 — Base + Dark (contrast)
5. Track 5 — Base + Intimate (mid-album breather)
6. Track 6 — Base + Energy (return to momentum)
7. Track 7 — Base (core sound, evolved)
8. Track 8 — Base + Dark + Energy (tension peak)
9. Track 9 — Base + Epic (climax)
10. Closing — Base + Intimate (resolution)

### Naming and Branding Your Music

**Track naming patterns that work:**

| Pattern | Example | Vibe |
|---------|---------|------|
| One word | "Emergence" | Minimal, artistic |
| Location + Time | "Tokyo Midnight" | Cinematic, evocative |
| Concept + Modifier | "Digital Serenity" | Modern, conceptual |
| Action phrase | "Breaking Through" | Energetic, motivational |
| Nature reference | "Morning Tide" | Peaceful, organic |

**Album naming patterns:**

| Pattern | Example | Vibe |
|---------|---------|------|
| Abstract concept | "Frequencies" | Artistic, cohesive |
| Journey metaphor | "From Here" | Narrative, personal |
| Time reference | "Golden Hour Sessions" | Atmospheric, curated |
| Place reference | "Amsterdam Nocturnes" | Specific, evocative |

---

## Commercial Distribution

### Platform Strategy

| Platform | Purpose | Reach | Revenue Model |
|----------|---------|-------|--------------|
| **Spotify** | Primary streaming | Massive | Per-stream ($0.003-0.005) |
| **Apple Music** | Quality audience | Large | Per-stream ($0.006-0.01) |
| **YouTube Music** | Discovery + video | Large | Ad-supported + premium |
| **Bandcamp** | Direct sales | Niche | Per-sale (you set price) |
| **SoundCloud** | Community + discovery | Medium | Free + paid tiers |

### Distribution Services

| Service | Annual Cost | Stores | Best For |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **DistroKid** | $22/year | 150+ | High volume, unlimited uploads |
| **TuneCore** | $30/year per album | 150+ | Single albums, established artists |
| **CD Baby** | $10/single | 150+ | One-time uploads, beginners |
| **Amuse** | Free tier available | Major stores | Budget-conscious starters |

**Recommendation for AI music creators:** DistroKid. Unlimited uploads at a flat annual fee matches the high-volume nature of AI music production.

### Release Strategy

**The Drip Release Pattern:**

Instead of dropping 50 songs at once, release strategically:

| Week | Release | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Single #1 | Test audience reception |
| 2 | Single #2 | Build momentum |
| 3 | Single #3 | Create anticipation |
| 4 | Full album/EP | Maximize algorithmic push |
| 5-8 | One per week | Maintain streaming velocity |

**Why this works:** Streaming algorithms favor consistent release schedules over bulk dumps. Each release triggers a notification to your followers and gets a brief algorithmic boost.

### Metadata That Matters

```
Title: [Clear, memorable, searchable]
Artist Name: [Consistent across all platforms]
Genre: [Primary genre + up to 2 secondary]
Mood tags: [Happy, Sad, Energetic, Calm, etc.]
BPM: [Accurate, helps playlist placement]
Key: [Musical key for DJ/mixing compatibility]
Description: [50-100 words with relevant keywords]
```

### Revenue Expectations

**Realistic streaming revenue for AI music:**

| Monthly Streams | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1,000 | $3-5 | $36-60 |
| 10,000 | $30-50 | $360-600 |
| 100,000 | $300-500 | $3,600-6,000 |
| 1,000,000 | $3,000-5,000 | $36,000-60,000 |

**Getting to 10K monthly streams** requires ~50+ published tracks across playlists that match common search moods (study, sleep, workout, meditation, focus).

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: The Extend and Develop Pattern

Suno's extend feature is your arrangement tool:

1. Generate a strong opening (Verse + Chorus)
2. Extend from the end with a new prompt variation ("Now add a bridge with only piano")
3. Extend again for the final chorus ("Return to full arrangement, powerful finale")
4. The result: a track with genuine musical development

### Technique 2: Genre Fusion

The most interesting tracks combine unexpected genres:

```
"Ambient trap, ethereal atmospheric pads with heavy 808 bass,
sparse hi-hat patterns, meditation meets hip hop production,
dark and contemplative, 70 BPM"
```

```
"Celtic electronic, traditional Irish fiddle melodies with
synthwave bass and arpeggiated synths, ancient meets future,
driving 4/4 beat, 120 BPM"
```

```
"Jazz-hop orchestral, upright bass and brushed drums with
full string section, hip hop beat programming, sophisticated
and cinematic, 90 BPM"
```

### Technique 3: Frequency-Based Music

For meditation and wellness content:

| Frequency | Association | Prompt Addition |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| 174 Hz | Pain relief, safety | "174 Hz solfeggio frequency base tone" |
| 396 Hz | Liberation from fear | "396 Hz root chakra healing frequency" |
| 432 Hz | Universal harmony | "432 Hz tuning, natural resonance" |
| 528 Hz | Transformation, DNA repair | "528 Hz love frequency, miracle tone" |
| 639 Hz | Connection, relationships | "639 Hz heart opening frequency" |
| 741 Hz | Awakening, expression | "741 Hz throat chakra activation" |
| 852 Hz | Intuition, spiritual order | "852 Hz third eye frequency" |
| 963 Hz | Cosmic consciousness | "963 Hz crown chakra divine connection" |

### Technique 4: Mood Playlist Curation

Create themed collections that streaming algorithms love:

| Playlist Theme | Track Count | Target Listener |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Deep Focus | 20-30 tracks | Students, remote workers |
| Morning Ritual | 15-20 tracks | Wellness enthusiasts |
| Night Drive | 15-20 tracks | Commuters, travelers |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many songs can I create per month with Suno?

On the Pro plan ($10/month), you get 500 credits. Each generation uses 5-10 credits depending on length. Practically, you can create 50-100 songs per month, more if you're efficient with extensions vs. new generations.

### Can I sell music made with Suno commercially?

Yes, on paid plans (Pro and Premier). Suno grants commercial rights including streaming distribution, sync licensing, and content use. Free tier is non-commercial only. Always check current terms at suno.com.

### How do I get my Suno music on Spotify?

Use a distribution service (DistroKid, TuneCore, CD Baby). Upload your tracks, add metadata, select stores, and submit. Spotify typically takes 3-5 business days to process. DistroKid ($22/year) is the most cost-effective for high-volume creators.

### Do I need to know music theory?

No, but basic understanding helps. Knowing the difference between major and minor keys, what BPM means, and basic song structure (verse/chorus/bridge) significantly improves your prompts. You can learn these basics in an afternoon.

### How do I make my AI music sound less "AI-generated"?

Three approaches: (1) Use detailed, specific prompts with production references instead of generic descriptions. (2) Use the extend feature to create genuine musical development across the track. (3) Select from many generations rather than publishing the first output. The curation step is what separates quality from noise.

### What genres work best with Suno?

Suno excels at: Lo-fi, ambient, electronic, pop, rock, cinematic, and hip hop instrumentals. It's improving at: Jazz, classical, R&B, and world music. It struggles with: Very complex arrangements, specific technical performances, and exact reproduction of rare subgenres.

### How do I create album artwork?

Use Midjourney or DALL-E 3. Prompt: `Album cover art for [ALBUM NAME], [GENRE AESTHETIC], [MOOD], [COLOR PALETTE], square format, no text, high quality --ar 1:1`. Add text (artist name, album title) in Figma or Canva for precise typography control.

### Can I use Suno music in YouTube videos?

Yes, on paid plans. Suno music on Pro/Premier plans can be used in YouTube content, podcasts, social media, and commercial projects. This is one of the highest-value use cases—original, royalty-free music for content creators.

### How do I get playlist placements on Spotify?

Three approaches: (1) Submit to Spotify's editorial playlists via Spotify for Artists (long shot, high reward). (2) Submit to independent playlist curators via SubmitHub, PlaylistPush, or direct outreach. (3) Create your own playlists and build followers organically. Consistent release schedules and proper genre tagging help algorithms recommend your music.

### How much can I earn from AI music streaming?

Realistically: $0 in month 1, $5-50/month after 6 months of consistent publishing, $50-500/month after 12+ months with 100+ tracks. Top AI music creators earning $1,000+/month have 500+ tracks optimized for high-demand moods (focus, sleep, meditation). It's a volume and consistency game.

### Is AI-generated music copyrightable?

This is evolving legally. Currently, purely AI-generated music has uncertain copyright status in most jurisdictions. However, music where you've made substantial creative choices (prompt design, curation, arrangement decisions, lyrics) likely qualifies for at least some protection. The practical risk of someone stealing your specific track is very low. Consult legal counsel for high-stakes applications.

### How do I develop a unique artistic style?

Start with a base style template and iterate on it for 50+ tracks. Your style emerges from the patterns you consistently choose—the genres you combine, the moods you gravitate toward, the instrumentation you prefer. Document what works. After 100 tracks, you'll have a recognizable creative fingerprint.

### Should I create a separate artist name for AI music?

Recommended. It separates your AI music catalog from other work, allows focused branding, and gives you freedom to experiment. Choose a name that reflects your musical aesthetic. Build its presence across Spotify, Apple Music, and social platforms.

### How do I handle AI music disclosure?

Transparency is recommended. Some platforms require AI disclosure, others don't. At minimum, note "Created with AI assistance" in your artist bio. Being upfront builds trust and avoids future complications as regulations evolve.
