# Skills Library Playbook

Subtitle: A practical guide to activating FrankX skills with precision and speed.

Last updated: 2025-03-01

## Why the skills library exists

FrankX is a multi-agent ecosystem. The skills library ensures every agent works from shared knowledge, patterns, and standards so the experience feels coherent across web, content, music, and systems work.

Use the skills library when you need to:

- Move fast without losing quality.
- Apply consistent brand and technical standards.
- Coordinate specialists across creative and engineering workflows.

---

## Quick start

1) Pick the task type (design, engineering, publishing, research).
2) Activate the matching skill file.
3) Follow the workflow inside the skill doc.
4) Ship, then document learnings back into the system.

## Core skill categories

- **Technical**: architecture, agent systems, database, Next.js patterns.
- **Creative**: brand voice, content creation, book writing.
- **Business**: product strategy and infrastructure.
- **Soulbook**: life design and coaching frameworks.

## Skill-to-agent alignment

- **Claude**: voice, storytelling, curriculum, creator-facing copy.
- **Codex**: system design, API models, architecture decisions.
- **Gemini**: implementation, QA, performance, accessibility.
- **OpenCode**: rapid prototyping, bug fixes, tooling.

---

## Activation checklist

- Confirm the output type: page, guide, workflow, script, or product.
- Read the relevant `SKILL.md` until you find the workflow and standards.
- Extract required assets, templates, or scripts.
- Execute the workflow, then add internal links to related resources.

## Recommended skill stack

- **Launches**: frankx-brand + frankx-content + nextjs-react-expert.
- **Agent builds**: mcp-architecture + claude-sdk + langgraph-patterns.
- **Creator education**: golden-age-book-writing + soulbook systems.
- **Performance**: ui-ux-design-expert + framer-expert.

## How to keep it clean

- Avoid duplicating content across skills; link instead.
- Keep each skill focused and under 200 to 300 lines.
- Update the registry whenever new skills are added.
- Share learnings in the daily intelligence log.
