# Skills Library Playbook

Subtitle: A practical guide to activating FrankX skills with precision and speed.

Last updated: 2025-03-01

## Why the skills library exists

FrankX is a multi-agent ecosystem (see our [Agent Collective Operating System guide](/guides/agent-collective-operating-system) for the full coordination layer). The skills library ensures every agent works from shared knowledge, patterns, and standards so the experience feels coherent across web, content, music, and systems work.

Use the skills library when you need to:

- Move fast without losing quality.
- Apply consistent brand and technical standards.
- Coordinate specialists across creative and engineering workflows.

---

## Quick start

1) Pick the task type (design, engineering, publishing, research).
2) Activate the matching skill file.
3) Follow the workflow inside the skill doc.
4) Ship, then document learnings back into the system.

---

## Core skill categories

- **Technical**: architecture, agent systems, database, Next.js patterns.
- **Creative**: brand voice, content creation, book writing.
- **Business**: product strategy and infrastructure.
- **Soulbook**: life design and coaching frameworks.

---

## Skill-to-agent alignment

- **Claude**: voice, storytelling, curriculum, creator-facing copy.
- **Codex**: system design, API models, architecture decisions.
- **Gemini**: implementation, QA, performance, accessibility.
- **OpenCode**: rapid prototyping, bug fixes, tooling.

---

## Activation checklist

- Confirm the output type: page, guide, workflow, script, or product.
- Read the relevant `SKILL.md` until you find the workflow and standards.
- Extract required assets, templates, or scripts.
- Execute the workflow, then add internal links to related resources.

---

## Recommended skill stack

- **Launches**: frankx-brand + frankx-content + nextjs-react-expert.
- **Agent builds**: mcp-architecture + claude-sdk + langgraph-patterns.
- **Creator education**: golden-age-book-writing + soulbook systems.
- **Performance**: ui-ux-design-expert + framer-expert.

For a practical look at how these skills power a complete creator workflow, see [The Creator AI Stack 2026](/guides/creator-ai-stack-2026). For AI-assisted content production using skills, check our [AI Writing System guide](/guides/ai-writing-system).

## How to keep it clean

- Avoid duplicating content across skills; link instead.
- Keep each skill focused and under 200 to 300 lines.
- Update the registry whenever new skills are added.
- Share learnings in the daily intelligence log.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a skills library in the context of AI agents?

A skills library is a structured collection of knowledge documents, patterns, and standards that AI agents reference when performing tasks. Instead of giving an agent instructions from scratch every time, skills provide reusable context — brand guidelines, technical patterns, workflow steps, and quality standards. Think of it as a training manual that ensures consistent, high-quality outputs regardless of which agent handles the work.

### How do I choose which skills to activate for a specific task?

Match the task type to the skill category: Technical skills for architecture and development, Creative skills for content and design, Business skills for strategy and products. For cross-functional work (like launching a new feature), combine skills from multiple categories — for example, `frankx-brand` + `nextjs-react-expert` for a branded web feature. The activation checklist in this guide walks you through the selection process.

### How many skills should I have active at once?

Keep active skills focused — 2-4 per task is the sweet spot. More skills means more context for the agent to process, which can dilute focus. Load your core brand/voice skill for everything, then add 1-3 task-specific skills. For example: brand skill + SEO skill + content writing skill for a blog post. Deactivate skills that aren't relevant to the current task.

### Can I create my own custom skills?

Yes. Custom skills are markdown files that document your specific patterns, standards, and workflows. Create a `.md` file with: purpose, when to use it, step-by-step workflow, quality standards, and examples. Keep each skill focused (under 200-300 lines) and link to related skills rather than duplicating content. The best custom skills emerge from documenting workflows that you've refined through repetition.

### How do skills differ from system prompts or custom instructions?

System prompts are conversation-level instructions that set the tone and role. Skills are domain-level knowledge bases — deeper, more structured, and reusable across conversations. A system prompt might say "write in a professional tone." A skill provides the complete brand voice document, content structure templates, SEO checklist, and quality gates. Skills are the knowledge layer; system prompts are the behavior layer.

### How do I keep the skills library organized and up to date?

Four practices: (1) Avoid duplication — link between skills rather than copying content. (2) Keep each skill under 300 lines — split larger topics into multiple skills. (3) Update the skill registry whenever you add or remove skills. (4) Review quarterly — remove outdated patterns, add new learnings. Document the review date at the top of each skill file so you know what's fresh.

### What's the relationship between skills and agent roles?

Agent roles define *who does the work* (Technical Architect, Content Engine, SEO Intelligence). Skills define *what they know*. The same skill can be used by multiple agents — for example, the brand voice skill is relevant to the Content Engine, SEO Intelligence, and Frontend Designer. The skill-to-agent alignment table in this guide maps which skills are most relevant to each agent role.

### How do I measure if my skills library is actually improving output quality?

Track three metrics: (1) Time-to-ship — does activating skills reduce how long tasks take? (2) Revision count — do outputs need fewer editing passes? (3) Consistency — do outputs from different sessions maintain the same quality and voice standards? If you're getting consistent, high-quality outputs with fewer revisions, your skills library is working. If outputs are still inconsistent, your skills need more specific examples and quality standards.
