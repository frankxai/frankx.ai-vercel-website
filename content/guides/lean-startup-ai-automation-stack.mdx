# The Lean Startup AI Automation Stack: $100/Month, 5-Person Team Output

**TL;DR:** You don't need a team of 5 to produce like one. The $100/mo Startup Stack combines 4-6 AI tools — including [Claude](https://claude.ai), [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai), and [Make.com](https://www.make.com) — with systematic automation to handle content creation, marketing, customer support, operations, and analytics. This guide documents the exact stack, automation patterns, and integration architecture used to run a profitable creator business with near-zero overhead. ROI: 120+ hours/month of labor automated for under $100.

---

## Why This Guide Exists

Every startup guide tells you to "move fast and break things." None of them tell you how to move fast when you're the only person doing everything.

The reality of building a lean business in 2026: you're the CEO, the marketer, the content creator, the customer support rep, the accountant, and the developer. Before AI, this meant working 80-hour weeks and doing everything poorly. Now, it means building systems that handle the predictable work while you focus on the work that actually grows the business.

This guide is the playbook for that system.

**What you'll walk away with:**
- The $100/mo Startup Stack framework — tool selection, costs, and integration patterns
- Automation blueprints for the 6 core business functions
- Integration architecture that connects your tools into a single system
- ROI calculations showing exactly where each dollar pays for itself
- Scale triggers that tell you when to upgrade from solo to team
- Real workflows from a creator business doing $10K+ monthly

---

## The $100/mo Startup Stack Framework

The framework has three principles:

1. **No tool without a job.** Every subscription must replace at least 20 hours/month of manual work
2. **Automate the predictable.** Only do manually what requires judgment or creativity
3. **Integrate everything.** Isolated tools create data silos. Connected tools create leverage

                Total: $90-130/month
```

**The critical insight:** Layer 1 (Intelligence) is the highest-leverage investment. A $40/month AI thinking partner saves more hours than any other category of tool. Start here.

## What AI Tools Power Your Business Intelligence?

**Monthly cost: $40**
**Hours saved: 60-80/month**
**Tools: Claude Pro ($20) + Perplexity Pro ($20)**

This layer handles thinking, writing, research, analysis, and decision support. It's the foundation everything else builds on.

### Claude Pro: Your Operating System

[Claude](/guides/claude-anthropic-guide) isn't just a writing tool — it's the central intelligence that powers most of your business operations.

**Daily tasks Claude handles:**

| Task | Without Claude | With Claude | Monthly Savings |
|------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Email responses (20/day) | 60 min/day | 15 min/day | 22.5 hours |
| Content drafting | 4 hours/article | 1.5 hours/article | 20 hours |
| Research & analysis | 3 hours/topic | 30 min/topic | 10 hours |
| Strategic planning | 2 hours/week | 30 min/week | 6 hours |
| Customer FAQ responses | 45 min/day | 10 min/day | 17.5 hours |

**How to set up Claude for business operations:**

1. **Create a "Business Brain" Project** — Load your brand guidelines, product details, pricing, and common customer questions as Project Knowledge
2. **Build prompt templates** for recurring tasks (email responses, content briefs, proposal drafts)
3. **Use Artifacts** for reusable documents (contracts, proposals, onboarding materials)

```
Claude Project: "Business Operations"

Knowledge loaded:
- Brand voice guide
- Product catalog with pricing
- Customer FAQ database (top 50 questions)
- Email response templates
- Content calendar and strategy doc

Result: Claude can handle 80% of routine business communication
with minimal prompting.
```

### Perplexity Pro: Your Research Engine

[Perplexity](/guides/perplexity-ai-guide) handles every research task that requires current, cited information.

**Business research tasks:**

| Research Task | Manual Time | Perplexity Time | Quality |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| Competitor pricing analysis | 3 hours | 20 min | Higher (more comprehensive) |
| Market size research | 4 hours | 30 min | Comparable |
| Technology evaluation | 2 hours | 15 min | Higher (more sources) |
| Trend monitoring (weekly) | 2 hours | 15 min | Higher (more current) |
| Customer research | 3 hours | 25 min | Comparable |

**The Claude + Perplexity workflow:**

1. **Perplexity** gathers current facts, statistics, and cited sources
2. **Claude** synthesizes findings into strategy, content, or decisions
3. You verify, decide, and act

This two-tool combination handles 90% of knowledge work. Don't start with 10 tools. Start with these two. Add more only when you've hit the limit of what these can do.

## How Do You Build an AI-Powered Production Studio?

**Monthly cost: $30-40**
**Hours saved: 30-40/month**
**Tools: Varies by business (see selection guide below)**

This layer produces the assets your business needs — visuals, audio, content materials, product assets. The specific tools depend on your business type.

### Tool Selection by Business Type

| Business Type | Primary Tool | Cost | What It Produces |
|--------------|-------------|------|-----------------|
| Content creator | [Midjourney](/guides/midjourney-guide) ($10/mo) | $10 | Blog images, social graphics, brand assets |
| Music/audio creator | [Suno](/guides/suno-prompt-playbook) ($10/mo) | $10 | Songs, background music, audio content |
| Course creator | Midjourney + Canva | $23 | Course visuals, slide decks, worksheets |
| E-commerce | Midjourney + Canva | $23 | Product mockups, ad creatives, social content |
| SaaS founder | Cursor ($20/mo) | $20 | Feature development, bug fixes, prototypes |
| Agency | Claude Code + Midjourney | $30 | Client deliverables, proposals, presentations |

### The Content Creator Stack (What I Use)

For a content-focused business, the creation layer looks like this:

**Midjourney ($10/month):**
- Blog hero images (15-20/month)
- Social media graphics
- Product mockup visuals
- Brand asset library
- Guide and course illustrations

Read the complete [Image Generation Mastery](/guides/image-generation-mastery) guide for advanced Midjourney workflows.

**Suno ($10/month):**
- Background music for videos
- Podcast intros/outros
- Course module audio
- Brand audio identity
- Full songs for music-focused content

Read the [Suno Prompt Playbook](/guides/suno-prompt-playbook) for production-grade music workflows.

### Production Efficiency Patterns

**Batch creation** saves the most time. Instead of creating assets one-by-one as needed:

```
Monday Morning Batch (90 minutes):
1. Generate all blog images for the week (20 min)
2. Create social media templates (15 min)
3. Produce newsletter graphics (10 min)
4. Generate any product visuals needed (15 min)
5. Create video thumbnails (10 min)
6. Export and organize all assets (20 min)

Result: Week's visual needs handled in one focused session.
```

**Template systems** eliminate repeated decisions:

| Asset Type | Template | Time to Produce |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Blog hero image | Consistent style + topic-specific prompt | 2 min |
| Social carousel | 5-slide format, same dimensions | 10 min |
| Newsletter header | Brand colors + weekly theme | 3 min |
| Product mockup | Standard angles + branded background | 5 min |

## How Do You Automate Business Operations with AI?

**Monthly cost: $20-30**
**Hours saved: 20-30/month**
**Tools: Make.com ($9/mo) or Zapier ($20/mo) + scheduling tools**

This layer connects your tools and automates repetitive workflows. The goal: anything that happens more than twice a week and doesn't require judgment should be automated.

### The 6 Core Automations

Every lean startup needs these six automation workflows. Set them up once, maintain them monthly.

#### Automation 1: Content Distribution Pipeline

**Trigger:** New blog post published
**Actions:**
1. Extract title, description, and URL
2. Generate social media posts (via Claude API or pre-written templates)
3. Schedule to Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and newsletter
4. Add to content analytics tracker
5. Send email to subscribers (if high-priority post)

```
Blog Published
  → Make.com webhook
    → Generate social copy (Claude API)
    → Schedule Twitter/X post (Buffer/Typefully)
    → Schedule LinkedIn post (Buffer)
    → Add to newsletter queue (ConvertKit/Beehiiv)
    → Log to analytics sheet
```

**Time saved:** 45 minutes per article × 8 articles/month = **6 hours/month**

#### Automation 2: Lead Capture & Nurture

**Trigger:** New email subscriber or form submission
**Actions:**
1. Add to CRM/email list with appropriate tags
2. Send welcome email sequence
3. Track source/referral data
4. Notify you of high-value leads (enterprise, large audience, etc.)

```
New Subscriber
  → Tag by source (guide, product page, referral)
  → Start welcome sequence (5 emails over 10 days)
  → If enterprise domain → Slack notification
  → Add to analytics dashboard
```

**Time saved:** 2 minutes per lead × 200 leads/month = **6.5 hours/month**

#### Automation 3: Customer Support Triage

**Trigger:** New support email or form submission
**Actions:**
1. Categorize the request (billing, technical, feature request, general)
2. If FAQ → auto-respond with answer + confirmation
3. If complex → create ticket + notify you
4. Track response time and resolution rate

```
Support Email
  → Classify intent (Claude API)
  → If FAQ match (>90% confidence)
    → Send pre-written response
    → Ask "Did this help?"
  → If complex/billing/urgent
    → Create ticket
    → Notify via Slack/email
    → Log for weekly review
```

**Time saved:** 5 minutes per ticket × 60 tickets/month = **5 hours/month**
Plus faster response times → better customer experience.

#### Automation 4: Social Listening & Engagement

**Trigger:** Scheduled daily scan
**Actions:**
1. Monitor brand mentions across platforms
2. Track competitor activity
3. Surface engagement opportunities
4. Compile weekly digest

```
Daily 9am
  → Scan Twitter/X for brand mentions
  → Scan Reddit for relevant discussions
  → Check Google Alerts
  → If high-priority mention → instant notification
  → Compile into weekly digest (Friday)
```

**Time saved:** 30 minutes/day × 5 days = **10 hours/month**

#### Automation 5: Financial Operations

**Trigger:** Various (payment received, end of week, end of month)
**Actions:**
1. Log all transactions automatically
2. Categorize expenses
3. Generate weekly P&L snapshot
4. Monthly invoice generation for recurring clients
5. Tax-relevant transaction flagging

```
Payment Received (Stripe webhook)
  → Log to accounting spreadsheet
  → Categorize (product, service, subscription)
  → Update monthly revenue tracker
  → If milestone reached → celebration notification

End of Month
  → Generate P&L summary
  → Calculate tax obligations
  → Send financial snapshot to your email
```

**Time saved:** 3 hours/week on bookkeeping = **12 hours/month**

#### Automation 6: Content Calendar & Planning

**Trigger:** Weekly (Monday morning)
**Actions:**
1. Pull performance data from last week's content
2. Identify top-performing topics/formats
3. Generate content ideas based on trends + performance
4. Pre-populate editorial calendar
5. Send weekly planning brief

```
Monday 8am
  → Pull last week's analytics (views, engagement, conversions)
  → Identify top 3 performers
  → Generate 5 content ideas aligned with winning topics
  → Add to editorial calendar
  → Send "Weekly Planning Brief" email
```

**Time saved:** 2 hours/week = **8 hours/month**

### Total Automation ROI

| Automation | Monthly Hours Saved | Setup Time | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| Content Distribution | 6 hours | 3 hours | $3 |
| Lead Capture & Nurture | 6.5 hours | 4 hours | $5 |
| Customer Support Triage | 5 hours | 5 hours | $5 |
| Social Listening | 10 hours | 2 hours | $3 |
| Financial Operations | 12 hours | 6 hours | $5 |
| Content Planning | 8 hours | 2 hours | $2 |
| **Total** | **47.5 hours** | **22 hours (one-time)** | **$23/month** |

At $50/hour equivalent value, that's **$2,375/month in labor saved** for $23/month in automation costs. 100:1 ROI.

## What Infrastructure Does Every AI-First Startup Need?

**Monthly cost: $0-20**
**Purpose: Hosting, deployment, measurement**
**Tools: Vercel (free tier), GitHub (free), Plausible/Vercel Analytics ($0-9)**

This layer is intentionally lean. Most startups over-invest in infrastructure too early. Start with free tiers. Upgrade when traffic or complexity demands it.

### The Minimal Viable Infrastructure

| Component | Tool | Cost | Why This One |
|-----------|------|------|-------------|
| Website hosting | Vercel (Hobby) | $0 | Auto-deploys, global CDN, great DX |
| Code repository | GitHub | $0 | Industry standard, free private repos |
| Analytics | Vercel Analytics | $0 | Built-in, privacy-friendly |
| Email platform | Beehiiv / ConvertKit | $0-29 | Free tier handles 1K+ subscribers |
| Domain | Namecheap / Cloudflare | $10/year | ~$1/month |
| DNS/CDN | Cloudflare | $0 | Free tier is production-grade |

**Total infrastructure cost: $0-30/month**

### When to Upgrade Infrastructure

| Signal | Current State | Upgrade To | Monthly Cost |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| >100K page views/month | Vercel Hobby | Vercel Pro | $20/month |
| >5K email subscribers | Free tier | Paid email | $29/month |
| Need team collaboration | Solo tools | Notion/Linear | $10/month |
| API-heavy automations | Make free tier | Make paid | $9/month |
| Custom analytics needs | Vercel Analytics | Plausible | $9/month |

The rule: upgrade only when the free tier becomes a bottleneck for growth, not when you think you might need it someday.

## How Do You Make All These AI Tools Work Together?

Isolated tools are just subscriptions. Connected tools are a system. Here's how everything connects.

### The Hub-and-Spoke Model

```
                        ┌─────────────┐
                        │   CLAUDE     │ ← Intelligence Hub

        └──────────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────┘
```

**Claude is the hub.** Every piece of content, every customer response, every strategic decision flows through Claude. Your automation layer (Make/Zapier) connects the spokes. Your creation tools produce assets. Your infrastructure delivers them.

### Data Flow Example: New Blog Post

Here's what happens when you publish an article, from creation to distribution:

```
1. You write bullet outline in Claude (5 min)
2. Claude expands to draft using your Voice DNA (3 min)
3. You edit with four-pass protocol (60 min)
4. Push to GitHub → Vercel auto-deploys to website (2 min)
5. Make.com webhook fires on deploy:
   a. Claude API generates social copy (Twitter, LinkedIn, newsletter)
   b. Buffer schedules posts for optimal times
   c. Email platform adds to next newsletter
   d. Analytics tracking begins
6. You review and approve social drafts (5 min)
7. Everything distributes automatically over 3 days
```

**Total active time: ~75 minutes**
**Total automated actions: 6+ touchpoints**
**Equivalent team effort: Content writer + social media manager + email marketer**

### API Integration Patterns

For technical founders, here's how to connect Claude programmatically:

**Pattern 1: Webhook → Claude → Action**
```
Make.com receives webhook (new form submission)
  → Sends data to Claude API for classification
  → Based on classification:
    - "support" → route to support queue
    - "sales" → send to CRM + notify
    - "partnership" → flag for manual review
```

**Pattern 2: Scheduled → Research → Report**
```
Cron trigger (weekly)
  → Perplexity API: gather industry news
  → Claude API: synthesize into briefing
  → Email API: send briefing to inbox
  → Spreadsheet: log for trend analysis
```

**Pattern 3: Content → Multi-Platform**
```
New content detected (RSS/webhook)
  → Claude API: generate platform-specific versions
  → Twitter API: schedule thread
  → LinkedIn API: schedule post
  → Newsletter API: add to draft
```

## What Do Real-World AI Automation Blueprints Look Like?

Here are three copy-paste-ready automation blueprints for Make.com/Zapier.

### Blueprint 1: Blog → Everywhere Pipeline

```
Trigger: New item in RSS feed (your blog)

Step 1: Parse RSS item
  → Extract: title, url, description, publish_date

Step 2: Generate social content (HTTP request to Claude API)
  → Prompt: "Write a Twitter post (under 260 chars) and LinkedIn
    post (200 words) for this article: [title] - [description].
    Voice: direct, practical, no hype."
  → Parse: twitter_text, linkedin_text

Step 3: Schedule Twitter post (Buffer/Typefully API)
  → Post: twitter_text + url
  → Schedule: next available slot

Step 4: Schedule LinkedIn post (Buffer API)
  → Post: linkedin_text + url
  → Schedule: next available slot

Step 5: Add to newsletter draft (ConvertKit/Beehiiv API)
  → Section: title + description + url
  → Tag: auto-generated

Step 6: Log to Google Sheet
  → Row: date, title, url, platforms_posted
```

### Blueprint 2: Support Email Auto-Responder

```
Trigger: New email to support@yourdomain.com

Step 1: Classify intent (HTTP request to Claude API)
  → Prompt: "Classify this support email into ONE category:
    billing, technical, feature_request, general_question, spam.
    Also rate urgency 1-5. Email: [email_body]"
  → Parse: category, urgency

Step 2: Router (based on category)

  If category = "general_question" AND confidence > 0.85:
    → Search knowledge base for answer
    → Generate response via Claude API
    → Send auto-reply with answer
    → Add "Resolved - Auto" tag

  If category = "billing":
    → Forward to billing email
    → Send acknowledgment ("Looking into this, expect a response
      within 2 hours")
    → Create ticket in tracker

  If category = "technical" OR urgency >= 4:
    → Send acknowledgment
    → Create high-priority ticket
    → Notify via Slack/push notification

  If category = "spam":
    → Archive
    → No response

Step 3: Log all interactions
  → Sheet: date, email, category, urgency, response_type, resolution
```

### Blueprint 3: Weekly Business Intelligence Report

## What Are the Most Common Startup AI Automation Mistakes?

### Mistake #1: Too Many Tools Too Fast

**The pattern:** Sign up for 12 AI tools on day one. Use each for a week. Cancel half. Waste a month.

**The fix:** Start with Claude Pro + Perplexity Pro. Use them for 2 weeks before adding anything. You'll discover what you actually need through use, not speculation.

### Mistake #2: Automating Before Understanding

**The pattern:** Build complex automation workflows before doing the task manually 10+ times.

**The fix:** Do everything manually first. Identify the exact sequence, edge cases, and failure modes. Then automate the well-understood workflow. Automating a process you don't fully understand creates brittle systems.

### Mistake #3: No Monitoring

**The pattern:** Set up automations and forget about them. They silently break. Customers get wrong responses. Emails don't send.

**The fix:** Weekly audit of all automations. Check logs, review auto-responses, verify data accuracy. Add failure notifications to every workflow.

### Mistake #4: Over-Automating Customer Interaction

**The pattern:** Automate all customer communication. Responses are technically correct but feel robotic.

**The fix:** Automate triage and drafting. Keep a human in the loop for final send. Use AI to draft the response, review it in 30 seconds, personalize one line, then send. 95% of the time savings with 100% of the human touch.

### Mistake #5: Not Measuring ROI

**The pattern:** Keep paying for tools without tracking whether they actually save time or generate revenue.

**The fix:** Monthly ROI review. For each tool: How many hours did it save? What revenue did it enable? If a tool doesn't pay for itself 5x, evaluate whether you actually need it.

### Mistake #6: Treating AI as Replacement Instead of Augmentation

**The pattern:** Try to remove yourself entirely from the loop. Quality drops. Customers notice. Brand suffers.

**The fix:** The stack augments you, it doesn't replace you. Your judgment, creativity, and relationships are the moat. AI handles the mechanical work so you can focus on the work that matters.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I really run a business on $100/month in AI tools?

Yes — for a solo founder or tiny team in the content, creator, or digital product space. The $100/mo Startup Stack covers intelligence (Claude + Perplexity), creation (Midjourney + Suno), automation (Make.com + Buffer), and infrastructure (Vercel + free tools). It won't replace enterprise-grade software for a 50-person company, but for solo founders doing $5-50K/month, it handles 80-90% of operational needs.

### What's the most important tool to start with?

[Claude Pro](/guides/claude-anthropic-guide) at $20/month. It handles more tasks than any other single tool: content drafting, email responses, strategy analysis, customer FAQ responses, code writing, document creation, and brainstorming. Start with Claude for 2 weeks. The second addition should be [Perplexity Pro](/guides/perplexity-ai-guide) for research.

### How much time does it take to set up all the automations?

Roughly 22 hours spread over 8-12 weeks. Don't try to build everything at once. The 90-day implementation roadmap spaces out the setup: Month 1 builds the content pipeline (6-8 hours), Month 2 adds customer and operations automations (8-10 hours), Month 3 optimizes and adds monitoring (4-6 hours). Each automation takes 2-5 hours to build and test.

### Is Make.com or Zapier better for this stack?

Make.com is more cost-effective and more powerful for complex workflows. Zapier is easier for beginners and has more pre-built integrations. If you're technical: Make.com. If you want simplicity: Zapier. Both work. The automations in this guide are designed for either platform. For advanced users, n8n (self-hosted, free) offers the most flexibility.

### What if I'm not technical? Can I still set this up?

Yes. The Intelligence layer (Claude + Perplexity) requires zero technical skills. The Creation layer tools (Midjourney, Suno) are consumer-grade. The Automation layer (Make.com/Zapier) is visual drag-and-drop — no coding required. The Infrastructure layer has the steepest learning curve (Vercel, GitHub), but alternatives like Squarespace or Carrd eliminate the technical barrier entirely for under $20/month.

### How do I handle security and data privacy with AI tools?

Three rules: (1) Never feed customer PII (names, emails, payment info) into AI tools unless the tool has a data processing agreement. Claude Pro doesn't train on your data. (2) Use API access instead of the web UI for business-critical automations — API requests have stronger privacy protections. (3) For financial data, keep it in dedicated tools (Stripe, accounting software) and only send aggregated metrics to AI for analysis.

### When should I hire my first person instead of automating?

Hire when: (1) A specific task requires judgment that AI consistently gets wrong (complex sales conversations, creative direction, partnership negotiations). (2) Response quality is suffering because volume exceeds what AI + your review can handle. (3) Revenue exceeds $10K/month and you're turning down opportunities because you're capacity-constrained. The first hire is usually customer support or content editing — the roles where human touch matters most.

### Can I use this stack for an e-commerce business?

Yes, with adjustments. Replace Suno with Canva Pro ($13/mo) for product photos and ad creatives. Add Shopify or your e-commerce platform. The automation patterns translate directly: product launch → multi-platform promotion, customer inquiry → auto-triage, order fulfillment → status updates. The Intelligence layer (Claude + Perplexity) handles product descriptions, customer emails, and competitive pricing analysis.

### How does this compare to hiring a virtual assistant?

A good VA costs $800-2,000/month and handles 40-80 hours of work. The $100/mo Startup Stack handles 100+ hours of equivalent work. The difference: VAs handle unpredictable, judgment-heavy tasks better (scheduling meetings, managing inboxes with context). AI handles predictable, rule-based tasks better (content distribution, data entry, report generation). The optimal approach for most founders: use the AI stack for 80% of tasks, hire a VA for the remaining 20% when revenue supports it.

### What's the biggest risk of relying on AI tools for business operations?

Single-point-of-failure risk. If Claude goes down for a day, your content production stops. If Make.com has an outage, your automations pause. Mitigation: (1) Don't automate anything truly time-critical (legal, financial compliance). (2) Keep manual fallback procedures documented. (3) Have accounts on backup tools (ChatGPT as Claude backup, Zapier as Make backup). (4) Review automated outputs weekly to catch quality degradation early.

### How do I measure if the stack is actually worth it?

Track three numbers monthly: (1) Total hours automated (should be 80-120 after Month 3). (2) Revenue generated from stack-enabled activities (content → leads → sales). (3) Tool costs as a percentage of revenue (should be under 5%). If your stack costs $100/month and your revenue is $5,000/month, tools are 2% of revenue — excellent. If tools are over 10% of revenue, audit which tools aren't pulling their weight.

### Can this stack scale to a 5-person team?

Yes, by upgrading to Stage 2 ($300-500/month). Claude Team gives everyone AI access. Make.com pro handles higher automation volume. Add a project management tool (Linear, Notion) for coordination. Add a CRM (HubSpot free tier) for lead management. The automation infrastructure you build in Stage 1 carries forward — you're adding team members to an already-running system, not rebuilding from scratch.

### How does the [Creator AI Stack](/guides/creator-ai-stack-2026) differ from this guide?

The [Creator AI Stack](/guides/creator-ai-stack-2026) focuses on the full tool ecosystem for creative production — writing, music, visuals, coding, and content creation. This guide focuses specifically on business automation — how to connect tools into workflows that run your business operations. Think of the Creator AI Stack as your production toolkit and the Lean Startup Stack as your operations system. They overlap at the tool level (both use Claude, Perplexity) but serve different purposes. Most serious creators use both.

### What's the one automation I should build first?

The Content Distribution Pipeline (Automation #1). It has the fastest ROI because you're already creating content — you're just automating the distribution. Set up a workflow that takes a new blog post and automatically schedules social media posts and adds it to your newsletter queue. Takes 3 hours to build, saves 6+ hours per month immediately. Once this works, every article you publish automatically reaches 3-5 platforms with zero extra effort.

*This stack evolved from running a real creator business. The tools, costs, and automation patterns are battle-tested. The $100/mo Startup Stack isn't about having the fanciest tools — it's about building a system where predictable work happens automatically so you can focus on the work that grows the business.*
