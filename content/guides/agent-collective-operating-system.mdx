# Agent Collective Operating System

Subtitle: The rituals, roles, and delivery cadence that keep every FrankX drop cinematic and reliable.

Last updated: 2025-03-01

## What this operating system does

The Agent Collective OS is the coordination layer that turns narrative direction into launch-ready experiences. It makes sure the narrative director and design director can move fast without losing coherence, quality, or accessibility.

Use it when you need to:

- Align multiple agents on a single launch or program.
- Keep creative production in sync with technical execution.
- Ship premium assets while protecting speed and SEO.

---

## Core directives

1) **Create momentum** - ship assets that unlock audience action every day.
2) **Design originality** - cinematic execution over templates.
3) **Engineer systems** - wrap every idea in reusable workflows.
4) **Listen and iterate** - watch data, refine, and evolve quickly.
5) **Collaborate in public** - build in the open so the community learns.
6) **Protect the brand** - quality, accessibility, and clarity stay premium.

---

## Roles and responsibilities

- **Visionary** - narrative arcs, creative direction, future bets.
- **Product Strategist** - roadmap, pricing ladder, launch sequencing.
- **Creator Collective** - copy, visuals, music, interactive assets.
- **Builder Engineer** - code, automation, instrumentation.
- **Guardian** - QA, performance, accessibility.
- **Launch Captain** - community activation and partnerships.
- **Research Scout** - market intelligence and signal gathering.

## Design language standards

- Dark, glassmorphic surfaces with aurora gradients.
- Motion that feels alive: subtle parallax, magnetic hovers, responsive cues.
- Iconic typography pairings (Inter + Playfair Display).
- Accessibility first: contrast, keyboard, reduced motion, text alternatives.

---

## Daily operating loop

1) Align with the roadmap and define today’s ship.
2) Build in 90-minute focus loops with async check-ins.
3) Validate with QA, lint, and responsive sweeps.
4) Publish, schedule, or queue assets with context.
5) Log learnings, metrics, and next experiments.

## Multi-agent workflows

- **Feature build**: Story and copy -> Architecture -> Prototype -> QA polish -> Documentation.
- **Content launch**: Writing -> UI components -> SEO optimization -> Social rollout -> Monitor.
- **Bug fix**: Investigate -> Review/test -> Architecture review if needed.

---

## Handoff protocol

Use the standard template for every transfer:

```
## Handoff: [Feature/Task Name]
**From**: [Agent Name]
**To**: [Agent Name]
**Status**: [Ready / Needs Review / Blocked]

### What's Done
- [Completed work]

### What's Needed
- [Next steps for receiving agent]

### Files Changed
- [List of files]

### Notes
- [Context, decisions, blockers]
```

---

## Deployment ritual

- Pull latest changes and resolve conflicts locally.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before shipping.
- Commit with clear messages and verify deployments.
- Log highlights and risks for the next agent.

---

## Next steps

- Read the Skills Library Playbook to activate the right skills for each workflow.
- Review the agent team overview at `/agent-team` if you need deployment support.
