# Getting Started with Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's command-line interface for AI-assisted software development. This guide walks you through setup, essential commands, and workflows that make it genuinely useful.

---

## What Claude Code Does

Claude Code brings AI directly into your terminal. Unlike web-based chat interfaces:

- **Context-aware** - It understands your entire codebase
- **Action-oriented** - It can read, write, and execute
- **Persistent** - Sessions maintain context across tasks
- **Integrated** - Works with your existing dev tools

---

## Part 1: Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- An Anthropic API key
- Terminal access (macOS, Linux, or WSL on Windows)

### Install via npm

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Authenticate

```bash
claude-code auth
```

This opens a browser window for authentication. Once complete, you're ready.

### Verify Installation

```bash
claude-code --version
```

---

## Part 2: Essential Commands

### Start a Session

```bash
claude-code
```

This launches an interactive session in your current directory.

### One-Shot Commands

```bash
claude-code "explain what this project does"
claude-code "find all TODO comments in the codebase"
claude-code "add error handling to src/api.ts"
```

### Common Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--model` | Select model (opus, sonnet, haiku) |
| `--print` | Output response and exit |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | Skip permission prompts |

---

## Part 3: Effective Prompting

### Be Specific About Files

```
Read src/components/Button.tsx and explain the props interface
```

vs.

```
Explain the Button component
```

The first is faster because Claude doesn't need to search.

### Describe the "Why"

```
Refactor the authentication flow to use JWTs instead of sessions.
We need this because the app will be deployed to multiple regions.
```

Context about purpose leads to better decisions.

### Break Down Complex Tasks

Instead of:
```
Build a complete user authentication system
```

Try:
```
Let's build auth step by step:
1. First, create the user model in prisma/schema.prisma
2. Then we'll add the auth routes
3. Finally, we'll add middleware
```

---

## Part 4: Reading and Understanding Code

### Explore a New Codebase

```
Give me an overview of this project's architecture.
Focus on:
1. Entry points
2. Key abstractions
3. Data flow
```

### Find Patterns

```
Find all places where we make API calls.
Show me the pattern we use for error handling.
```

### Trace Execution

```
Trace what happens when a user submits the contact form.
Start from the form component and follow through to the database.
```

---

## Part 5: Writing Code

### Create New Features

```
Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page.
Use the existing useTheme hook in lib/hooks.
Match the design system in components/ui.
```

### Fix Bugs

```
There's a bug where the cart total doesn't update after removing items.
The issue is in components/Cart.tsx.
Find and fix it.
```

### Refactor Safely

```
Refactor the user service to use the repository pattern.
Keep all existing tests passing.
Don't change the public API.
```

---

## Part 6: Working with Tests

### Generate Tests

```
Write unit tests for src/utils/validation.ts.
Cover edge cases for:
- Empty input
- Invalid email formats
- Special characters
```

### Debug Failing Tests

```
This test is failing:
[paste test output]

Find the bug and fix it.
```

### Run and Verify

```bash
claude-code "run the test suite and summarize any failures"
```

---

## Part 7: Git Integration

### Commit Workflow

```
Review my staged changes and suggest a commit message.
Follow conventional commit format.
```

### Pull Request Prep

```
Summarize all changes since main branch.
Write a PR description covering:
- What changed
- Why
- How to test
```

### Code Review

```
Review the diff for potential issues:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance problems
- Style inconsistencies
```

---

## Part 8: Project-Specific Context

### CLAUDE.md Files

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root:

```markdown
# Project Context

## Architecture
This is a Next.js 14 app with App Router.
Database is PostgreSQL via Prisma.

## Conventions
- Use server components by default
- Keep client components in /components/client
- All API routes go in /app/api

## Important Files
- lib/db.ts - Database client
- lib/auth.ts - Authentication helpers
- types/index.ts - Shared types
```

Claude Code reads this file automatically.

---

## Part 9: Slash Commands

### Built-in Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation |
| `/compact` | Toggle compact output |
| `/model` | Switch AI model |

### Custom Commands

Create `.claude/commands/` directory for custom commands:

```markdown
# .claude/commands/review.md

Review the current file for:
1. Security issues
2. Performance optimizations
3. Code style improvements

Suggest fixes with code examples.
```

Then use: `/project:review`

---

## Part 10: Workflows That Work

### Morning Standup

```
What files have I modified since yesterday?
Summarize the changes for a standup update.
```

### End of Day

```
Review today's changes.
Are there any incomplete features or potential issues?
What should I tackle first tomorrow?
```

### Before Deploying

```
Run a pre-deployment check:
1. Are there any console.logs left in?
2. Any TODO comments that need addressing?
3. Are all env variables documented?
```

## Quick Reference

### Model Selection

| Model | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| Opus | Complex architecture, difficult bugs |
| Sonnet | Daily development (default) |
| Haiku | Quick questions, simple tasks |

### Performance Tips

1. **Start specific** - Give file paths when you know them
2. **Stay focused** - One task per conversation for complex work
3. **Use context** - Create CLAUDE.md for project conventions
4. **Verify outputs** - Review generated code before committing

---

## Next Steps

1. Install Claude Code in your most active project
2. Create a `CLAUDE.md` with project context
3. Try the morning standup workflow for a week
4. Build custom commands for your repetitive tasks

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Claude Code and how is it different from Claude.ai?

Claude Code is Anthropic's command-line interface (CLI) tool that brings AI directly into your terminal. Unlike Claude.ai (the web chat interface), Claude Code can read your entire codebase, write and edit files, run commands, and manage git workflows. It understands your project structure and can take action — not just suggest. Think of Claude.ai as a conversation partner and Claude Code as a hands-on development collaborator.

### Do I need to be an experienced developer to use Claude Code?

You need basic terminal comfort — navigating directories, running commands, and understanding file structures. But you don't need to be a senior developer. Claude Code is particularly valuable for intermediate developers because it explains concepts while building, essentially teaching as it works. If you can open a terminal and run `npm install`, you can use Claude Code effectively.

### How much does Claude Code cost?

Claude Code uses your Anthropic API credits (pay-per-token) or is included with a Claude Max subscription. API costs vary by model: Haiku for quick tasks is cheapest, Sonnet for daily development is moderate, and Opus for complex architecture work costs more. A typical development session might cost $0.50-5.00 depending on complexity and model choice. Monitor your usage at console.anthropic.com.

### What's the best model to use with Claude Code?

Sonnet is the best default for daily development — fast, capable, and cost-effective. Use Opus for complex architecture decisions, difficult debugging, or when you need the deepest reasoning. Use Haiku for quick questions, simple file changes, or when you want fast answers without deep analysis. You can switch models mid-session with the `/model` command.

### What is CLAUDE.md and why do I need it?

CLAUDE.md is a markdown file in your project root that Claude Code reads automatically at the start of every session. It provides persistent context about your project: architecture decisions, coding conventions, important file locations, and team patterns. Without it, Claude Code starts fresh each session. With a good CLAUDE.md, it immediately understands your project's context and conventions, producing more relevant and consistent results.

### Can Claude Code break my project or make destructive changes?

Claude Code asks permission before executing commands or modifying files. You control what it can do through permission settings. That said, always use version control (git) and review changes before committing. Claude Code integrates well with git — it can show you diffs of what it changed and help write commit messages. For extra safety, work on feature branches.

### How does Claude Code handle large codebases?

Claude Code indexes your project structure and reads files on demand — it doesn't load everything into memory at once. For large monorepos, it can navigate effectively by understanding directory structure and following imports. Point it to specific files when you know what to change (this is faster), or let it explore when you need broader analysis. CLAUDE.md helps by documenting where key logic lives.

### Can I use Claude Code with VS Code or other editors?

Claude Code is a standalone terminal tool that works alongside any editor. Many developers run Claude Code in one terminal pane while editing in VS Code in another. There's also a VS Code extension for tighter integration. The key benefit of the CLI approach is that it works with any editor, any terminal, and any workflow.

### What are custom slash commands and how do I create them?

Custom slash commands let you save frequently-used prompts as reusable commands. Create a `.claude/commands/` directory in your project and add markdown files — each file becomes a command. For example, `.claude/commands/review.md` containing review instructions becomes `/project:review`. This is powerful for standardizing team workflows like code review, deployment checklists, or documentation generation.

### How do I get the best results from Claude Code?

Three key practices: (1) Be specific about files — say "read src/auth/login.ts and fix the validation bug" instead of "fix the login bug." (2) Provide context about why — "we need JWTs because we're deploying to multiple regions" leads to better architecture decisions. (3) Break complex tasks into steps — instead of "build an auth system," work through it piece by piece: model first, then routes, then middleware. See our [Claude AI Guide](/guides/claude-anthropic-guide) for more prompting strategies.
