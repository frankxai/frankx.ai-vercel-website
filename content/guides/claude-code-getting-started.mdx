# Getting Started with Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's command-line interface for AI-assisted software development. This guide walks you through setup, essential commands, and workflows that make it genuinely useful.

---

## What Claude Code Does

Claude Code brings AI directly into your terminal. Unlike web-based chat interfaces:

- **Context-aware** - It understands your entire codebase
- **Action-oriented** - It can read, write, and execute
- **Persistent** - Sessions maintain context across tasks
- **Integrated** - Works with your existing dev tools

---

## Part 1: Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- An Anthropic API key
- Terminal access (macOS, Linux, or WSL on Windows)

### Install via npm

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Authenticate

```bash
claude-code auth
```

This opens a browser window for authentication. Once complete, you're ready.

### Verify Installation

```bash
claude-code --version
```

---

## Part 2: Essential Commands

### Start a Session

```bash
claude-code
```

This launches an interactive session in your current directory.

### One-Shot Commands

```bash
claude-code "explain what this project does"
claude-code "find all TODO comments in the codebase"
claude-code "add error handling to src/api.ts"
```

### Common Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--model` | Select model (opus, sonnet, haiku) |
| `--print` | Output response and exit |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | Skip permission prompts |

---

## Part 3: Effective Prompting

### Be Specific About Files

```
Read src/components/Button.tsx and explain the props interface
```

vs.

```
Explain the Button component
```

The first is faster because Claude doesn't need to search.

### Describe the "Why"

```
Refactor the authentication flow to use JWTs instead of sessions.
We need this because the app will be deployed to multiple regions.
```

Context about purpose leads to better decisions.

### Break Down Complex Tasks

Instead of:
```
Build a complete user authentication system
```

Try:
```
Let's build auth step by step:
1. First, create the user model in prisma/schema.prisma
2. Then we'll add the auth routes
3. Finally, we'll add middleware
```

---

## Part 4: Reading and Understanding Code

### Explore a New Codebase

```
Give me an overview of this project's architecture.
Focus on:
1. Entry points
2. Key abstractions
3. Data flow
```

### Find Patterns

```
Find all places where we make API calls.
Show me the pattern we use for error handling.
```

### Trace Execution

```
Trace what happens when a user submits the contact form.
Start from the form component and follow through to the database.
```

---

## Part 5: Writing Code

### Create New Features

```
Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page.
Use the existing useTheme hook in lib/hooks.
Match the design system in components/ui.
```

### Fix Bugs

```
There's a bug where the cart total doesn't update after removing items.
The issue is in components/Cart.tsx.
Find and fix it.
```

### Refactor Safely

```
Refactor the user service to use the repository pattern.
Keep all existing tests passing.
Don't change the public API.
```

---

## Part 6: Working with Tests

### Generate Tests

```
Write unit tests for src/utils/validation.ts.
Cover edge cases for:
- Empty input
- Invalid email formats
- Special characters
```

### Debug Failing Tests

```
This test is failing:
[paste test output]

Find the bug and fix it.
```

### Run and Verify

```bash
claude-code "run the test suite and summarize any failures"
```

---

## Part 7: Git Integration

### Commit Workflow

```
Review my staged changes and suggest a commit message.
Follow conventional commit format.
```

### Pull Request Prep

```
Summarize all changes since main branch.
Write a PR description covering:
- What changed
- Why
- How to test
```

### Code Review

```
Review the diff for potential issues:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance problems
- Style inconsistencies
```

---

## Part 8: Project-Specific Context

### CLAUDE.md Files

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root:

```markdown
# Project Context

## Architecture
This is a Next.js 14 app with App Router.
Database is PostgreSQL via Prisma.

## Conventions
- Use server components by default
- Keep client components in /components/client
- All API routes go in /app/api

## Important Files
- lib/db.ts - Database client
- lib/auth.ts - Authentication helpers
- types/index.ts - Shared types
```

Claude Code reads this file automatically.

---

## Part 9: Slash Commands

### Built-in Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation |
| `/compact` | Toggle compact output |
| `/model` | Switch AI model |

### Custom Commands

Create `.claude/commands/` directory for custom commands:

```markdown
# .claude/commands/review.md

Review the current file for:
1. Security issues
2. Performance optimizations
3. Code style improvements

Suggest fixes with code examples.
```

Then use: `/project:review`

---

## Part 10: Workflows That Work

### Morning Standup

```
What files have I modified since yesterday?
Summarize the changes for a standup update.
```

### End of Day

```
Review today's changes.
Are there any incomplete features or potential issues?
What should I tackle first tomorrow?
```

### Before Deploying

```
Run a pre-deployment check:
1. Are there any console.logs left in?
2. Any TODO comments that need addressing?
3. Are all env variables documented?
```

---

## Quick Reference

### Model Selection

| Model | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| Opus | Complex architecture, difficult bugs |
| Sonnet | Daily development (default) |
| Haiku | Quick questions, simple tasks |

### Performance Tips

1. **Start specific** - Give file paths when you know them
2. **Stay focused** - One task per conversation for complex work
3. **Use context** - Create CLAUDE.md for project conventions
4. **Verify outputs** - Review generated code before committing

---

## Next Steps

1. Install Claude Code in your most active project
2. Create a `CLAUDE.md` with project context
3. Try the morning standup workflow for a week
4. Build custom commands for your repetitive tasks
