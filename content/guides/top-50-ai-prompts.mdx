## Quick Reference

### Best Practices

1. **Be specific** - Vague prompts get vague results
2. **Set constraints** - Word limits, format requirements
3. **Provide context** - Who's the audience, what's the goal
4. **Iterate** - Use follow-up prompts to refine
5. **Combine** - Mix prompts for unique outputs

### Model Selection

| Task | Best Model |
|------|------------|
| Writing | Claude, GPT-4 |
| Code | Claude, GPT-4 |
| Images | Midjourney, DALL-E 3 |
| Music | Suno, Udio |
| Quick tasks | GPT-3.5, Haiku |

2. Customize them with your specifics
3. Test and iterate
4. Build your personal prompt library
5. Explore the full [Prompt Library](/prompt-library)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which AI model should I use these prompts with?

For writing and content prompts (1-10), [Claude](/guides/claude-anthropic-guide) and GPT-4 both excel — Claude produces more nuanced writing, GPT-4 is more versatile. For coding prompts (11-20), Claude is strongest, especially with Claude Code for file-based work. Image prompts (21-30) work with Midjourney, DALL-E 3, and Stable Diffusion — adjust syntax for each platform. Music prompts (31-40) are designed for Suno AI. Business prompts (41-50) work well with any major model.

### How do I customize these prompts for my specific needs?

Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics, but also add context about your audience, voice, and constraints. For example, instead of just replacing [topic], add: "My audience is independent musicians aged 25-40 who are tech-curious but not technical. My voice is warm and practical." The more context you provide, the better the output. Save your customized versions as templates — a good prompt library compounds over time.

### Why do some prompts work better than others?

Prompt quality depends on: (1) Specificity — vague requests get generic results. (2) Structure — prompts with clear format instructions produce more useful outputs. (3) Constraints — word limits, tone requirements, and audience definitions focus the AI. (4) Context — background information helps the AI make better decisions. The prompts in this collection are structured specifically because structure consistently outperforms open-ended requests.

### Can I combine multiple prompts for complex projects?

Yes, and this is one of the most powerful techniques. For a product launch: use Prompt #6 (Product Description) + Prompt #2 (Email Sequence) + Prompt #3 (LinkedIn Post) + Prompt #8 (Twitter Thread) to create a complete launch content package from a single product brief. Chain them sequentially, feeding the output of one into the context of the next. See our [AI Writing System guide](/guides/ai-writing-system) for systematic multi-prompt workflows.

### How often should I update my prompt library?

Review and refine prompts monthly. AI models improve and change, so prompts that worked three months ago might need updating. Track which prompts consistently produce good results and which need iteration. When a model updates (like a new GPT version), test your key prompts and adjust. The prompts in this collection are updated regularly based on model improvements and real-world testing.

### Do these prompts work with free AI tools or only paid versions?

Most prompts work with free tiers, but paid models (Claude Pro, ChatGPT Plus) produce significantly better results — especially for complex writing, coding, and reasoning prompts. Image prompts require paid subscriptions to Midjourney or ChatGPT Plus (for DALL-E 3). Music prompts require a Suno subscription. For the best results from writing and business prompts, a paid AI subscription is the single highest-ROI tool investment a creator can make.

### How do I build my own prompt library from scratch?

Start with 5 prompts from this collection that match your weekly tasks. Customize them, test them, and save the versions that work. Add one new prompt per week for tasks you repeat. Organize by category (writing, social, email, research) in a Notion page or markdown file. After 3 months, you'll have a personal library of 15-20 battle-tested prompts that save hours every week. Quality over quantity — 15 great prompts beat 100 untested ones.

### What's the difference between a prompt and a system prompt?

A regular prompt is your message in a single conversation. A system prompt is persistent context that shapes all responses — like giving the AI a job description before every interaction. System prompts (available in Claude Projects, ChatGPT Custom GPTs, and APIs) are where you put voice guidelines, audience context, and recurring instructions. Use regular prompts from this collection within the context of a good system prompt for the best results.

### Are these prompts safe to use for commercial content?

Yes. These are prompt templates — the instructions you give to AI, not the AI's output. The outputs you generate are yours to use commercially (check each AI platform's terms of service for specifics). For commercial content, always review and edit AI outputs before publishing: check facts, verify claims, ensure brand voice consistency, and add your original insights. AI-generated content needs human judgment before going live.

### How do I know if a prompt is producing good results?

Three evaluation criteria: (1) Usefulness — can you use the output with minimal editing? If you're rewriting 80% of it, the prompt needs work. (2) Specificity — does the output address your exact situation, or does it read like generic advice? (3) Voice — does it sound like something you would write or approve? If a prompt consistently fails these three tests after 2-3 attempts, restructure it with more context and constraints.
