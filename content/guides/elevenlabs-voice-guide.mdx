## Pro Tips for Quality Output

### 1. Write for Speech

Written text doesn't always sound natural spoken. Optimize your scripts:

**Instead of:** "The aforementioned solution provides approximately 47% efficiency gains"
**Write:** "This solution improves efficiency by almost fifty percent"

Tips:
- Use contractions (don't vs. do not)
- Spell out numbers for natural reading
- Add punctuation for pacing
- Break long sentences

### 2. Use SSML for Control

Speech Synthesis Markup Language gives precise control:

```xml
<speak>
  Welcome to <emphasis level="strong">ElevenLabs</emphasis>.
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Let's learn about voice AI.
</speak>
```

Common SSML tags:
- `<break time="Xs"/>` - Add pauses
- `<emphasis>` - Stress words
- `<prosody rate="slow">` - Adjust speed

### 3. Generate in Sections

For long content:
- Break into logical sections (paragraphs or scenes)
- Generate each section separately
- Review and regenerate problem areas
- Combine in audio editing software

### 4. Match Voice to Content

| Content Type | Voice Qualities |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Tutorial | Clear, steady, friendly |
| Storytelling | Expressive, varied pace |
| News/Updates | Professional, authoritative |
| Meditation | Calm, slow, soothing |
| Sales/Promo | Energetic, confident |

### 5. Post-Processing

ElevenLabs output is good, but post-processing improves it:
- Normalize audio levels
- Add subtle compression
- Remove any artifacts
- Add music or sound design
- Export in appropriate format

## Integration with Creator Workflow

1. **Write** - Create article or script with Claude
2. **Generate** - Convert to audio with ElevenLabs
3. **Distribute** - Publish as podcast, video narration, or audio article
4. **Clip** - Extract highlights for social media

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Not previewing before committing**
Always preview with your actual text before generating. Different voices handle different content better.

**Ignoring voice settings**
Default settings are good but not optimal. Experiment with stability and clarity for your specific use case.

**Processing huge texts at once**
Break long content into sections. It's easier to edit, and you won't lose everything if one section needs regeneration.

**Skipping post-processing**
Raw ElevenLabs audio is good, but basic audio editing (normalization, compression) makes it professional.

**Not checking usage**
Character counts add up. Monitor your usage to avoid mid-project surprises.
