# Multi-Agent System Adoption: Q1 2026

**TL;DR**: 72% of enterprise AI projects now use multi-agent architectures, up from 45% in 2024. LangGraph leads framework adoption at 34%, with MCP protocol emerging as the integration standard.

## Implications for AI Architects

1. **Multi-agent is no longer experimental** - With 72% adoption, it's the default architecture
2. **Framework choice matters less than patterns** - Top frameworks converge on similar patterns
3. **MCP is becoming the integration standard** - Plan for MCP-first tool integration
4. **Observability is the new battleground** - Production systems need tracing

## Methodology

- **Sample**: 500+ enterprise AI projects
- **Period**: October 2025 - January 2026
- **Sources**: G2, Gartner, McKinsey, Stack Overflow, GitHub, npm/pip statistics
- **Validation**: Cross-referenced minimum 2 independent sources per claim
