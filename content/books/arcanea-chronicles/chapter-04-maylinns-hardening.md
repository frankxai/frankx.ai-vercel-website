# Chronicle IV: Maylinn's Hardening

## The Story of the Guardian of Heart

Before Maylinn guarded the Gate of Heart, she hardened her own.

When Lumina shaped her from pure love—giving her essence of compassion and connection, bonding her with Laeylinn the Heart-Deer—the First Light said: "You will be the Guardian of Heart. You will teach seekers to love."

Maylinn overflowed with tenderness. Every being she met, she loved. Every pain she witnessed, she felt. There was no separation between her heart and the hearts of others.

Then the Dark Lord rose.

Maylinn felt it all—every soul corrupted, every being unmade, every moment of suffering in that terrible war. The pain was beyond bearing. The love that connected her to all things became the channel through which all pain flowed into her.

She could not continue. To feel was to die.

So Maylinn hardened. She closed the Heart-Gate within herself, sealed herself away from the suffering of others, became stone where she had been warmth.

Laeylinn wept. *"You have closed,"* the Heart-Deer said. *"You who are meant to open others have closed yourself."*

"I had to. The alternative was dissolution."

*"And is this life? Sealed away? Unfeling? You survive, but do you live?"*

Maylinn had no answer. She existed—but without the love that had defined her, she was a hollow Guardian. She tested seekers at the Gate of Heart, but her tests were rote, mechanical. She no longer knew what she was testing for.

Then a seeker came—one who had closed for the same reasons. A survivor of the Dark Lord's war, one who had witnessed unimaginable horrors and sealed their heart to survive.

"You are closed," Maylinn said.

"As are you," the seeker answered. "I can feel it—or rather, I cannot feel you. You are Guardian of Heart, but your heart is stone."

Maylinn would have wept, if she could still weep. "I closed to survive. The pain was too great."

"I know. I did the same. But now... I am tired of stone. I would rather feel again, even if feeling hurts."

"How? How do you open a heart that has been closed so long?"

"I do not know. But perhaps we can try together?"

And they did. Slowly, painfully, Maylinn and the seeker opened together—not all at once, not completely, but enough. Enough to feel again. Enough to love again. Enough to bear the pain that love required.

Now Maylinn teaches: "The closed heart survives but does not live. The open heart suffers but is alive. I have known both. Choose life."
