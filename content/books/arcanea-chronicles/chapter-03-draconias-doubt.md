# Chronicle III: Draconia's Doubt

## The Story of the Guardian of Fire

Before Draconia guarded the Gate of Fire, she doubted her flames.

When Lumina shaped her from pure will—giving her essence of fire and transformation, bonding her with Draconis the Primordial Dragon—the First Light said: "You will be the Guardian of Fire. You will teach seekers to claim their power."

Draconia burned with certainty. Power was her domain. Will was her weapon. None could stand against her flames.

Then the first seeker came—a gentle soul, a healer, one who had never raised a hand in violence and never wished to.

"I must pass your Gate?" the healer asked. "But I have no fire. I have no will to power. I seek to help, not to dominate."

Draconia prepared to test this seeker as she tested all—with attack, with flames that burned spirit as well as body. But she hesitated.

*"Why do you pause?"* Draconis asked.

"This one... has no fire. What can I teach one who does not burn?"

*"Perhaps that there is more than one kind of fire. Perhaps that power is not only aggression. Perhaps that will can heal as well as harm."*

Draconia had never considered this. Her fire had always been fierce, explosive, conquering. But what if there was also gentle fire? Warming fire? The fire that nurtures life rather than consumes it?

She looked at the healer and saw, for the first time, a flame—not fierce but steady. Not explosive but enduring. The fire of devotion. The fire of service. The fire that keeps burning when all other fires have died.

"I have doubted," Draconia told the healer. "I thought there was only one kind of power—the power that destroys. But you show me another: the power that sustains. Pass. You have taught me something I did not know."

Now Draconia tests all seekers—but she looks for many kinds of fire. The fierce and the gentle. The conquering and the nurturing. All fire is fire. All will is will. The Gate of Power admits many flames.
