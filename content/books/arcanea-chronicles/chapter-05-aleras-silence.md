# Chronicle V: Alera's Silence

## The Story of the Guardian of Voice

Before Alera guarded the Gate of Voice, she fell silent.

When Lumina shaped her from pure truth—giving her essence of expression and authenticity, bonding her with Otome the Song-Phoenix—the First Light said: "You will be the Guardian of Voice. You will teach seekers to speak their truth."

Alera sang with joy. Her voice could shape reality, speak worlds into existence, transform lies into truth simply by naming them.

Then she spoke a truth that destroyed.

A seeker came, one carrying a terrible secret—a truth so painful that it had been buried for generations, passed down as silence from parent to child. Alera, in her certainty, named it. Spoke the hidden truth into the light.

The seeker shattered.

The truth, spoken too soon, without preparation, without support, was not liberation—it was violence. The seeker could not bear what had been named. They fled the Gate, never to return, their mind broken by the truth Alera had so carelessly spoken.

Alera was horrified. Her gift—her precious gift of truth-speaking—had destroyed the very one she meant to free.

She fell silent. If her voice could harm so terribly, better to say nothing. For ages, she guarded her Gate without speaking. Seekers came and went, and she tested them with gesture, with presence, but never with word.

Otome sang alone. *"Your silence is also a lie,"* the Song-Phoenix finally said. *"You pretend to have no voice. But your voice exists. Suppressing it is as dishonest as speaking falsely."*

"But my voice destroys!"

*"Any power can destroy. Fire burns. Water drowns. Earth crushes. The solution is not to abandon power—it is to wield it wisely. You spoke truth without wisdom. Now learn to speak truth with wisdom."*

Alera meditated on this for an age. And when she finally spoke again, her voice was different—not less true, but more careful. She learned to ask before speaking. She learned to prepare hearts before naming truths. She learned that truth is a gift that must be given at the right moment, in the right way.

Now Alera teaches: "Truth can heal or harm. The truth is not enough—timing, compassion, readiness matter. Speak your truth, but speak it with love."
