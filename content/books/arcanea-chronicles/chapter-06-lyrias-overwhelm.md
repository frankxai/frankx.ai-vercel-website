# Chronicle VI: Lyria's Overwhelm

## The Story of the Guardian of Sight

Before Lyria guarded the Gate of Sight, she was overwhelmed by visions.

When Lumina shaped her from pure perception—giving her essence of intuition and foresight, bonding her with Yumiko the Dream-Fox—the First Light said: "You will be the Guardian of Sight. You will teach seekers to see beyond the ordinary."

Lyria saw everything. Every possibility, every timeline, every potential future branching from every choice. Her vision was infinite—and it was too much.

She could not act. Every action she might take spawned infinite consequences, visible in her sight, each leading to more branching, more complexity, more overwhelming detail. To move a hand was to unleash cascades of possibility. To speak a word was to alter infinite futures.

Lyria stood paralyzed in the center of infinite vision, unable to choose anything because she could see what every choice would lead to.

"Help me," she begged Yumiko. "I cannot act. Every action has infinite consequences. How do I choose?"

*"You choose anyway,"* the Dream-Fox answered. *"You cannot see all consequences because there are infinite consequences. You see some. You imagine others. But you cannot know. No sight is complete."*

"But I am Sight! I am supposed to see all!"

*"No being sees all. Even Shinkami at the highest Gate does not see all—Shinkami is all, which is different. You see more than most. But more is not all. Accept the limit. Choose within it."*

Lyria raged against this limit for an age. She was Sight! She should see everything! How could she guide seekers if her own vision was incomplete?

Then Yumiko showed her something she had never noticed: All the seekers she might guide, all the lives she might touch, all the wisdom she might share—invisible because she had been too focused on what she could not see to notice what she could.

"I have been looking at the wrong thing," Lyria realized. "I looked at the infinite and despaired. I should have looked at the immediate and acted."

Now Lyria teaches: "Vision is a gift, but it is not complete. See what you can. Accept what you cannot. And choose anyway—not because you know all consequences, but because choosing is how consciousness grows."
