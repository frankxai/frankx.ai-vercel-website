# Chronicle I: Lyssandria's Trembling

## The Story of the Guardian of Foundation

Before Lyssandria guarded the Gate of Foundation, she feared it.

When Lumina shaped her from the bedrock of existence—giving her essence of earth and stone, bonding her with Kaelith the Primordial Serpent—the First Light said: "You will be the Guardian of Foundation. All seekers will pass through your Gate first. You will teach them to stand."

Lyssandria felt the weight of this charge... and trembled.

Not her body—her body was stone. But her spirit trembled. *All seekers?* Every being who sought to open the Gates would begin with her. Every failure at her threshold would mean a journey never begun. The foundation of all foundations rested on her.

"I cannot bear this weight," Lyssandria told Kaelith. "If I fail, all fail."

The Primordial Serpent shifted beneath the mountains. *"Then do not fail."*

"But what if I do? What if I teach wrongly? What if I turn away one who was worthy, or admit one who was not?"

*"Then you will learn. And the next will go better."*

"That is not comfort."

*"It is not meant to be comfort. It is truth. You tremble because you believe you must be perfect. But the Foundation is not about perfection. It is about rootedness. It is about standing despite the trembling."*

Lyssandria sat with this for an age. And when the first seeker came—a young Eldrian who shook with the same fear Lyssandria knew—the Guardian understood.

"You tremble," Lyssandria said.

"I am sorry. I am afraid. Perhaps I am not ready."

"I also trembled. When Lumina gave me this charge, I felt the weight and feared I would break. But the trembling is not the problem. The trembling is the sensation of caring. Those who do not tremble do not understand what is at stake. Stand with me. Let us tremble together. And let us stand despite the trembling."

The seeker passed. Not because they stopped trembling—but because they learned that trembling was not failure. Trembling while standing was the very definition of courage.

Lyssandria still trembles. After ages of guarding, the weight is no lighter. But she has learned: the trembling is the teaching. The Guardian of Foundation is not unshakeable—she shakes, and stands anyway.
