# Energy

*The first pillar. Without energy, every other pillar collapses.*

## I. The Foundation

Energy is not motivation. Motivation is a feeling. Energy is a resource. Like money, it can be earned, spent, invested, and wasted. Unlike money, it regenerates — but only if you understand how.

Most people treat energy as fixed. They believe they are "morning people" or "night owls," high-energy or low-energy, naturally vibrant or naturally tired. All of this is learned. All of it can be changed.

## II. The Energy Audit

Before you can optimize energy, you must understand where it goes. For one week, track three things:

1. **Energy inputs**: What gave you energy? A workout, a conversation, a meal, a nap, sunlight, music, cold water.
2. **Energy drains**: What took energy? A meeting, an argument, processed food, doom-scrolling, poor sleep, alcohol.
3. **Energy level**: Rate each two-hour block from 1-10.

After seven days, the pattern is unmistakable. You will see exactly what charges you and what depletes you. And you will realize that most energy loss is self-inflicted.

## III. The Morning Protocol

The first 90 minutes of your day determine the next 14 hours.

Not because mornings are magic. Because the brain's neurochemistry in the first 90 minutes is uniquely receptive to pattern-setting. Cortisol naturally peaks at waking — this is not stress; this is readiness. Dopamine is available for direction. Adenosine (the sleepiness molecule) has been cleared by sleep.

Use this window wisely:

- **Light**: Bright light within 10 minutes of waking. Sunlight is ideal. It sets your circadian clock for the next 24 hours.
- **Movement**: 20-30 minutes of physical activity. Not optional. Not "if I feel like it." The body that moves first thinks better all day.
- **Cold**: A cold shower (30-90 seconds) triggers norepinephrine release — a natural alertness chemical that lasts 3-4 hours.
- **Hydration**: 500ml of water before coffee. Your body is dehydrated after 7-8 hours of sleep.
- **Delay caffeine**: Wait 90-120 minutes after waking. This prevents the afternoon crash that comes from stacking caffeine on top of natural cortisol.

## IV. Sleep as Investment

Sleep is not time off. Sleep is the highest-ROI activity in your entire day.

During sleep, your brain consolidates memories, clears metabolic waste, repairs tissue, and processes emotions. One night of poor sleep reduces cognitive performance by 25%. Five consecutive nights reduces it by 50%.

The sleep protocol is non-negotiable:

- Same time every night. The body craves rhythm.
- Cool room (18-19°C / 65°F). Core temperature must drop for deep sleep.
- No screens 60 minutes before bed. Blue light delays melatonin by 90 minutes.
- Dark room. Invest in blackout curtains. Light pollution disrupts REM cycles.
- No alcohol within 3 hours of sleep. Alcohol suppresses REM sleep even in small amounts.

## V. Nutrition as Fuel

You are not what you eat. You are what your mitochondria can convert into ATP.

The energy equation is straightforward: eat foods that your body can efficiently convert into cellular energy, and avoid foods that require excessive processing, cause inflammation, or spike and crash blood sugar.

Principles:

- **Protein at every meal**: 1.6-2.2g per kg of bodyweight daily. This is the building block of every energy system.
- **Complex carbohydrates**: Oats, rice, sweet potatoes. Steady energy, not spikes.
- **Healthy fats**: Olive oil, avocado, nuts. Essential for hormone production (and hormones control energy).
- **Minimize sugar**: Not because sugar is evil. Because sugar creates a cycle of spike-crash-crave that destabilizes energy for hours.
- **Hydration**: 35ml per kg of bodyweight daily. Dehydration is the most common and most ignored cause of low energy.

## VI. The Energy Rhythm

Energy is not constant. It flows in 90-120 minute cycles throughout the day (ultradian rhythms). Peak focus lasts about 90 minutes, followed by a 20-minute trough.

Work with the rhythm, not against it:

- Schedule deep work in 90-minute blocks.
- Take genuine breaks between blocks (walk, breathe, step outside).
- Schedule creative work for mornings, administrative work for afternoons.
- Protect your peak hours from meetings, emails, and interruptions.

The person who manages their energy rhythms outperforms the person who manages their time, every single day.

*Energy is the meta-skill. Master it, and every other area of life becomes easier. Neglect it, and even the simplest things become hard.*
