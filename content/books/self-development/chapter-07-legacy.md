# Legacy

---

*The seventh pillar. The only one that outlasts you.*

## I. The Long View

There is a thought experiment that changes everything.

Imagine you are 85 years old. You are sitting in a chair, looking back over the full arc of your life. From that vantage point — with all the noise gone, all the urgency dissolved, all the small anxieties revealed for what they were — what mattered?

Not the promotions. Not the cars. Not the likes or the followers or the quarterly targets.

What mattered was what you built that lasted. What you gave that grew beyond you. Who you became in the process of becoming.

This is legacy thinking. And it is the most powerful filter for daily decisions that exists.

## II. The Two Legacies

Every person leaves two legacies.

**The External Legacy** is what you create. The business, the art, the institution, the body of work. It is the thing that bears your name (or your influence) long after you are gone. External legacy requires craft, capital, and sustained effort over decades.

**The Internal Legacy** is who you shaped. The children you raised. The students you taught. The people whose lives changed because you were in them. Internal legacy requires presence, patience, and the willingness to invest in something whose returns you may never see.

Most people optimize for external legacy because it is visible. The truly wise person knows that internal legacy is the one that compounds across generations.

## III. The Body of Work

A legacy is not a single achievement. It is a body of work — the accumulated output of a lifetime of showing up.

The body of work does not need to be famous. It needs to be real. A carpenter who builds 500 houses leaves a body of work. A teacher who shapes 10,000 students leaves a body of work. A parent who raises kind, capable humans leaves a body of work.

To build a body of work:

- **Choose a domain.** You cannot leave a legacy in everything. Pick the area where your energy, talent, and values converge, and commit to it for decades.
- **Document as you go.** Write down what you learn. Teach what you know. Create artifacts that can outlast your memory. The knowledge that dies with you is knowledge wasted.
- **Prioritize durability over novelty.** The trendy thing fades. The fundamental thing endures. Build for the long shelf life.

## IV. Compound Lives

The most powerful concept in finance — compound interest — applies to every domain of life.

Small improvements, sustained over time, produce extraordinary results. This is true of money, fitness, relationships, skills, and reputation. The person who improves 1% per day is 37 times better at the end of one year. Over five years, the number is incomprehensible.

But compounding requires one thing: you cannot interrupt the chain.

The interruptions are what kill legacy. The year off. The "I'll get back to it." The reset that erases all accumulated gains. The person who shows up inconsistently for 30 years achieves less than the person who shows up consistently for 10.

Protect the chain. Even on the worst days — especially on the worst days — do the daily minimum. Keep the chain intact. And let time do the mathematics.

## V. Giving It Away

The final stage of legacy is letting go.

The knowledge you hoard dies with you. The wealth you clutch disappears into inheritance taxes and family disputes. The status you protect becomes irrelevant the moment the next generation rises.

But the knowledge you share multiplies. The wealth you deploy strategically transforms communities. The status you surrender in service of something larger becomes the kind of influence that lasts.

Give away your best ideas. Teach your most valuable skills. Invest in people and projects that will outlive you. This is not sacrifice. This is the only form of investment with an infinite time horizon.

## VI. The Measure

At the end, there is one question.

Not "How much did I earn?" Not "How many people knew my name?" Not "How much did I achieve?"

The question is: *Did I use what I was given?*

The energy, the mind, the soul, the craft, the capital, the circle — these are the raw materials of a life. They are given to everyone. Some in greater measure, some in lesser. But everyone receives enough to build something meaningful.

The tragedy is not failure. Failure is a teacher. The tragedy is unused capacity. The life that was comfortable but never stretched. The talent that was acknowledged but never deployed. The dream that was clear but never pursued.

Legacy is not about being remembered. It is about being used up. Fully. Completely. With nothing left in the tank and nothing left unsaid and nothing left ungiven.

That is the seventh pillar. And it is the one that holds up all the others.

*You are not building a life. You are building a legacy. The only question is whether it will be one of intention or one of accident.*
