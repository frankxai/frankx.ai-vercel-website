# Circle

*The sixth pillar. The people who surround you determine the ceiling of your growth.*

## I. The Average

You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.

Jim Rohn said this decades ago. Neuroscience has since confirmed it. Mirror neurons — the brain cells that fire both when you perform an action and when you observe someone else performing it — mean that proximity is programming. You absorb the habits, beliefs, ambitions, and limitations of the people around you, whether you intend to or not.

This is not a judgment on the people in your life. It is a recognition of how influence works. And it means that your circle is not a social choice. It is a strategic one.

## II. The Three Circles

Not everyone in your life plays the same role. Clarity comes from understanding the three circles.

**The Inner Circle (3-5 people).** These are the people who know you fully. No performance. No filter. They have seen you at your worst and chose to stay. They tell you the truth when you do not want to hear it. They celebrate your wins without jealousy and hold you accountable without judgment. This circle is sacred. Protect it. Invest in it. Never take it for granted.

**The Growth Circle (10-20 people).** These are the people who challenge you. They are further along the path you are walking. They operate at a level you aspire to. They do not make you comfortable — they make you better. This circle is aspirational. Seek it actively. Join communities, attend events, reach out to people you admire. Most people will not respond. Some will. And those few will change everything.

**The Extended Circle (everyone else).** Colleagues, acquaintances, online connections. These are relationships of exchange, not depth. They have value — information, opportunity, collaboration — but they should not be confused with the inner or growth circles. Keep them warm but do not invest emotional energy you do not have.

## III. The Audit

Most people have never audited their circle. They inherited it — from school, from work, from geography — and never questioned whether it still serves them.

The audit is uncomfortable but necessary:

- **Who drains you?** Not occasionally (everyone has bad days) but consistently. After every interaction, you feel diminished. Less motivated. Less capable. Less yourself.
- **Who elevates you?** After every interaction, you feel sharper. More ambitious. More clear about who you are and where you are going.
- **Who is neutral?** Neither draining nor elevating. Present but inert.

You do not need to cut people dramatically. You need to adjust allocation. Spend more time with the elevators. Less with the drains. And recognize that the neutral relationships may need a deliberate injection of depth — or they will drift into irrelevance.

## IV. The Art of Connection

Meaningful relationships are not found. They are built.

Building requires vulnerability. It requires the willingness to go first — to share something real before the other person does, to ask a genuine question instead of a social one, to follow up when it would be easier to forget.

Principles of deep connection:

- **Listen more than you speak.** Not performatively. Actually listen. The person who feels heard becomes the person who trusts you.
- **Remember details.** A name, a struggle, a goal they mentioned three months ago. Remembering tells the other person: you matter to me. And that is the foundation of every meaningful relationship.
- **Give without keeping score.** Make an introduction. Share a resource. Offer help before it is asked for. Generosity creates gravity — people orbit generous people.
- **Be consistent.** The check-in message. The birthday call. The "I saw this and thought of you." Small gestures, repeated over time, build bonds that grand gestures cannot.

## V. Mentorship

Every person needs three things: a mentor, a peer, and someone they mentor.

**The mentor** pulls you forward. They have been where you are going. They save you years of trial and error — not by giving you answers, but by asking you better questions.

**The peer** walks beside you. They understand the struggle because they are in it. They offer solidarity, competition, collaboration, and the comfort of being understood.

**The person you mentor** grounds you. Teaching forces clarity. Explaining your process reveals its gaps. And the act of helping someone behind you reminds you how far you have come — which is easy to forget when you are always looking at how far you have to go.

Find all three. If you cannot find a mentor in person, find one in books. If you cannot find a peer, create a group. If you cannot find someone to mentor, share what you know online. The format matters less than the function.

## VI. Boundaries as Love

The hardest part of circle management is boundaries.

Saying no to the friend who only calls when they need something. Limiting time with the family member who criticizes every decision. Declining the invitation from the group that celebrates mediocrity.

These are not acts of cruelty. They are acts of love — love for yourself, love for your potential, and love for the people who deserve the best version of you (which they cannot get if you are depleted by those who take without giving).

Boundaries are not walls. Walls block everything. Boundaries filter. They let the right things in and keep the wrong things out. And they must be maintained deliberately, because the moment you stop maintaining them, the default setting — which is to say yes to everything and everyone — takes over.

*Your circle is your culture. Choose it with the same care you would choose the city you live in, the food you eat, the thoughts you think. Because in the end, your circle does not just influence your life. It becomes your life.*
