# Rumi Speaks

---

*Seven meditations on the heart, from the mystic poet who understood that love is the only language the universe truly speaks.*

## I.

> Let yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you really love. It will not lead you astray.

There is a quiet knowing that lives beneath the noise. Beneath the schedules and the screens, beneath the plans we make and the plans that unmake us. It whispers. Most people never hear it because they are waiting for a shout.

Rumi heard it. Eight hundred years ago, in a land that no longer exists by the same name, a man who was already a scholar, already accomplished, already respected — met a wandering mystic named Shams. And everything he thought he knew dissolved like morning frost.

What replaced it was poetry.

Not the kind you study in school. The kind that arrives at 3am when you cannot sleep because your heart is so full it has forgotten how to be quiet.

## II.

> In your light I learn how to love. In your beauty, how to make poems. You dance inside my chest where no-one sees you, but sometimes I do, and that sight becomes this art.

Love teaches through its own existence. Not through instruction but through demonstration. You learn how to love by being loved. You learn how to create by being moved.

The poems Rumi wrote were not crafted at a desk. They were pulled from his chest like breath. Each one a confession. Each one a prayer. Each one evidence that the human heart has no bottom.

## III.

> Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along.

The greatest myth of love is the meeting. We tell stories of eyes across rooms, of first dates, of the moment it all began. But Rumi understood that love does not begin. It is recognized. It was always there, the way a river was always flowing before you discovered it.

When you find the one who makes the world suddenly make sense, you are not finding something new. You are remembering something ancient.

## IV.

> A heart filled with love is like a phoenix that no cage can imprison.

Distance. Time. Circumstance. The practical world builds cages of every material — obligation, geography, doubt, fear. And love burns through them all.

Not with violence. With warmth. The steady, patient warmth of a heart that has decided.

## V.

> This is how I would die into the love I have for you: As pieces of cloud dissolve in sunlight.

There is a surrender in love that looks like weakness to the untrained eye. To let go of the self, to dissolve the boundary between "I" and "you" — this is not weakness. This is the bravest act a human being can perform.

Rumi knew that love asks us to die — not physically, but to die to the illusion of separateness. To dissolve into something larger. Like a wave returning to the ocean, we do not lose ourselves. We find where we always belonged.

## VI.

> Goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes. Because for those who love with heart and soul, there is no such thing as separation.

Every airport goodbye. Every long night in different time zones. Every moment you reach for someone who is not beside you.

Rumi says: they are beside you. Not metaphorically. The heart does not understand distance. It only understands connection. And connection, once made, does not break because a body moves to another room, another city, another continent.

## VII.

> Through Love all that is bitter will be sweet, Through Love all that is copper will be gold, Through Love all dregs will turn to purest wine, Through Love all pain will turn to medicine.

This is the alchemy. Not turning lead into gold with fire and formulas, but turning an ordinary life into an extraordinary one through the simple, impossible act of loving fully.

The bitter morning becomes sweet when shared. The copper of routine becomes gold when someone laughs beside you. The dregs of failure become wine when someone holds your hand through it.

Love does not remove the hardness from life. It transmutes it. And that is better than removal. Because what we transform, we understand. And what we understand, we can never truly lose.

*These are not ancient words about a distant time. These are instructions for right now.*
