# To the Builders

This one is for you —
the ones still awake at 2 AM
not because you have to be,
but because you cannot stop.

For the ones who shipped something
on a Tuesday that nobody asked for,
and three months later someone wrote
to say it changed their workflow.
Their business. Their thinking.

For the ones who build
not because the market told them to,
but because the silence
in an empty editor
feels like an invitation.

The Fire Horse doesn't care
about your five-year plan.
It cares about *this year*.
*This month*.
*This morning*.

Build what matters.
The horse is already here.
