## I. When Death Comes

> When death comes
> like the hungry bear in autumn;
> when death comes and takes all the bright coins from his purse
>
> to buy me, and snaps the purse shut;
> when death comes
> like the measle-pox;
>
> when death comes
> like an iceberg between the shoulder blades,
>
> I want to step through the door full of curiosity, wondering:
> what is it going to be like, that cottage of darkness?
>
> And therefore I look upon everything
> as a brotherhood and a sisterhood,
> and I look upon time as no more than an idea,
> and I consider eternity as another possibility,
>
> and I think of each life as a flower, as common
> as a field daisy, and as singular,
>
> and each name a comfortable music in the mouth,
> tending, as all music does, toward silence,
>
> and each body a lion of courage, and something
> precious to the earth.
>
> When it's over, I want to say: all my life
> I was a bride married to amazement.
> I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.
>
> When it's over, I don't want to wonder
> if I have made of my life something particular, and real.
>
> I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened,
> or full of argument.
>
> I don't want to end up simply having visited this world.
>
> — *Mary Oliver*

She says: I want to step through the door full of curiosity. Not fear. Curiosity. *What is it going to be like, that cottage of darkness?*

This is the bravest poem about death ever written. Because it does not pretend death is not coming. It does not bargain. It does not rage. It walks toward the door with open hands and asks: what next?

If you are the one who is leaving — if you are reading this with the knowledge that your time is measured differently now than it used to be — then know this: Mary Oliver wrote this poem for you. Not to tell you how to feel. But to show you that there is a way to face what is coming with your eyes open and your heart full.

You have lived. You have been a bride married to amazement. You have taken the world into your arms. That is not nothing. That is everything.

## II. A Meditation on Letting Go

You have spent your whole life holding on.

Holding on to the people you love. Holding on to the work that gave you purpose. Holding on to the memories, the plans, the identity you built piece by piece over decades.

And now you are being asked to open your hands.

This is the hardest thing. Harder than pain. Harder than fear. The letting go. Because letting go feels like losing. And you have already lost enough.

But here is what the mystics, the monks, the poets, and the dying themselves have reported, across every culture and century: letting go is not losing. It is releasing the grip so that something larger can hold you.

You do not have to let go all at once. You can do it in stages.

First, let go of the small worries. The bills, the errands, the unfinished tasks. They will be handled. Or they won't, and that will be fine too.

Then, let go of the regrets. The things you wish you had done differently, the words you wish you had said or unsaid. You did your best with what you knew at the time. That is the truth.

Then, let go of the need to be strong. You have been strong long enough. It is okay to be soft now. It is okay to be afraid. It is okay to cry, to be confused, to say "I don't know what happens next."

Finally, let go of the need to understand. You do not have to figure out what death means. You do not have to believe the right thing. You just have to breathe. And when the breathing changes, let it change.

You are held. By the earth that has carried you. By the people who love you. By whatever mystery set the stars in motion.

## III. The Tibetan Perspective

In Tibetan Buddhism, death is not an ending. It is a *bardo* — a transitional state, a passage between one form of existence and another. The Tibetan Book of the Dead, the *Bardo Thodol*, is literally a guidebook for this passage. It is read aloud to the dying and the recently dead.

The core teaching is simple: do not be afraid of the light. As consciousness releases from the body, a great luminosity appears — a clear, brilliant light that is the nature of mind itself. The instinct is to recoil, to shy away, because the light is overwhelming. But the instruction is: move toward it. Merge with it. It is not something other than you. It is you, unmasked.

Whether or not you follow the Buddhist path, the metaphor is powerful. The moment of death may be a moment of extraordinary clarity — a moment when all the filters, defenses, and identities we have constructed fall away, and what remains is pure awareness. Pure being.

Many hospice workers report that patients, in their final hours, experience a moment of profound peace. Their faces soften. Their breathing slows. Sometimes they smile. Sometimes they speak to people in the room who no one else can see.

Whatever is happening in those moments, it does not look like suffering. It looks like arrival.

## IV. You Are Not Alone

> You are not the first
> to walk this path.
>
> Before you: billions.
> Every king and beggar.
> Every mother.
> Every child who grew old
> and every child who did not.
>
> They walked it
> and the path held.
>
> It will hold you too.
>
> You are not alone
> in this room,
> even when the room is empty.
>
> There are hands
> you cannot see
> reaching for yours.
>
> There are voices
> you cannot hear
> whispering:
>
> It is okay.
> You can rest now.
> We are here.
> We have always been here.
>
> The door is not locked.
> The door is not dark.
> The door is just a door.
>
> And on the other side,
> someone left the light on
> for you.

## V. Guided Visualization: The Garden Beyond

If you are able, close your eyes. If not, simply listen to these words as they are read to you.

Imagine a garden. Not a garden you have seen before, but one that exists just for you. It has been waiting for you. It has been growing while you lived your life, tended by unseen hands, fed by every act of love you ever performed.

The entrance is a low stone archway, covered in climbing roses. Pale gold. The scent is sweet but not heavy — like the first flowers of spring.

Walk through.

The path is soft beneath your feet. Warm stone, then moss, then grass. On either side, flowers you recognize and flowers you don't — colors that seem to glow from within. The light here is different. It comes from everywhere and nowhere. It is the light of early morning, perpetual and gentle.

Ahead, there is a bench beneath a tree. The tree is older than anything you have ever seen. Its branches spread wide, creating a canopy of green and gold light.

Sit.

And as you sit, notice that the garden is not empty. There are others here. Not crowding you. Not demanding anything. Just present. People who loved you. People you loved. Some you recognize. Some you have not yet met.

They are peaceful. They are home. And they are waiting — not impatiently, but the way a family waits for the last person to arrive at the table.

When you are ready, the table will be set.

There is no rush.

## VI. Permission

You have permission to stop fighting.
You have permission to be tired.
You have permission to not be brave.
You have permission to cry, or laugh, or be silent.
You have permission to eat ice cream for dinner.
You have permission to watch the same movie three times.
You have permission to ask for help.
You have permission to refuse visitors.
You have permission to say "I love you" more than feels socially appropriate.
You have permission to say "I'm scared."
You have permission to not know what comes next.
You have permission to believe in something, or nothing, or everything.
You have permission to change your mind.
You have permission to rest.

This life asked a great deal of you. You gave it. Now let yourself receive.
