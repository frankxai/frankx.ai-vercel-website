# Dichter der Hoffnung

---

_German poets of hope — Rilke, Goethe, Hesse — and the untranslatable concept of Geborgenheit: the feeling of being held safe in a world that is not._

## I. Wer nie sein Brot mit Tränen aß

> Wer nie sein Brot mit Tränen aß,
> wer nie die kummervollen Nächte
> auf seinem Bette weinend saß,
> der kennt euch nicht, ihr himmlischen Mächte.
>
> — *Johann Wolfgang von Goethe*

*He who never ate his bread with tears,*
*who never sat weeping on his bed*
*through sorrowful nights —*
*he does not know you, heavenly powers.*

Goethe wrote these lines over two hundred years ago, and they remain among the truest words in any language. The heavenly powers — whatever you call them: God, the universe, fate, the deeper current of existence — they are not known through triumph. They are known through tears.

This is not cruelty. It is intimacy.

The person who has wept through the night knows something the comfortable person does not. They know that the floor holds you even when you fall. That morning comes even when you are certain it will not. That something in the architecture of the world is built for survival — yours included.

## II. Rilke: Geduld mit dem Ungelösten

> Ich möchte Sie bitten, Geduld zu haben gegen alles Ungelöste
> in Ihrem Herzen und zu versuchen, die Fragen selbst liebzuhaben,
> wie verschlossene Zimmer und wie Bücher,
> die in einer sehr fremden Sprache geschrieben sind.
>
> Forschen Sie jetzt nicht nach den Antworten,
> die Ihnen nicht gegeben werden können,
> weil Sie sie nicht leben könnten.
> Und es handelt sich darum, alles zu leben.
>
> Leben Sie jetzt die Fragen.
> Vielleicht leben Sie dann allmählich,
> ohne es zu merken,
> eines fernen Tages
> in die Antwort hinein.
>
> — *Rainer Maria Rilke, Briefe an einen jungen Dichter*

*I want to ask you to be patient with everything unresolved in your heart and to try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books written in a very foreign language.*

*Do not search now for the answers, which could not be given to you because you would not be able to live them. The point is to live everything.*

*Live the questions now. Perhaps someday, without noticing it, you will live your way into the answer.*

When someone you love is dying, every cell in your body screams for answers. *Why them? Why now? What did we do wrong? What will happen after?*

Rilke does not tell you to stop asking. He tells you to live inside the questions. To treat the not-knowing as a room you inhabit rather than a prison you escape. This is not passivity. It is the deepest courage — to stand in uncertainty and not run.

The answers will come. Perhaps not in words. Perhaps in a gesture, a dream, a moment of unexpected peace while doing something ordinary. You will live your way into them.

## III. Wandrers Nachtlied

> Über allen Gipfeln
> Ist Ruh,
> In allen Wipfeln
> Spürest du
> Kaum einen Hauch;
> Die Vögelein schweigen im Walde.
> Warte nur, balde
> Ruhest du auch.
>
> — *Johann Wolfgang von Goethe*

*Over all the hilltops*
*Is peace,*
*In all the treetops*
*You feel*
*Hardly a breath;*
*The little birds are silent in the woods.*
*Just wait — soon*
*You too shall rest.*

This is perhaps the most perfect short poem in the German language. Goethe wrote it on the wall of a wooden hunting lodge in 1780, on a quiet evening in the Thuringian forest. He was thirty-one.

He would return to that lodge decades later, as an old man, and see the words still there on the wall. He wept.

The poem is not about death, though it speaks to it. It is about the peace that exists above all the struggle. The hilltops are quiet. The trees are still. The birds have stopped singing — not because something is wrong, but because night has arrived and night is gentle.

*Warte nur* — just wait. The German carries a tenderness that English cannot quite hold. It is the voice of a parent to a restless child. It is the voice of the universe to a weary soul. *Just wait. Your rest is coming.*

## IV. Hesse: Die Seele

> Man braucht vor niemand Angst zu haben.
> Wenn man jemanden fürchtet,
> dann kommt es daher,
> dass man diesem Jemand Macht
> über sich eingeräumt hat.
>
> — *Hermann Hesse*

*One need not be afraid of anyone. If you fear someone, it is because you have given that someone power over you.*

Hesse understood that fear — of death, of loss, of the unknown — is not inherent. It is constructed. We build it brick by brick with our expectations, our attachments, our insistence that things should be other than they are.

This does not mean fear is wrong. It means it can be examined. You can pick up each brick and look at it. *What am I actually afraid of? The loss itself, or the life after the loss? The dying, or the not knowing what dying means?*

Hesse's entire body of work circles one idea: that the soul is permanent, that it moves through forms the way water moves through vessels. Whether you believe this literally or metaphorically, the comfort is the same. What is essential about the people we love — their warmth, their humor, their particular way of making the world better — that does not end when the body ends. It lives on in everyone they touched.

## V. Geborgenheit

There is a word in German that has no English equivalent: *Geborgenheit*.

It means something like safety, warmth, comfort, being-held — all at once. It is the feeling of being a child carried in from the rain. The feeling of a warm room after a cold walk. The feeling of someone's hand on your back when you are crying and they say nothing, because nothing needs to be said.

*Geborgen* — the root — means sheltered, protected, secure. But *Geborgenheit* goes further. It is not just physical safety. It is the deep, soul-level knowledge that you belong somewhere. That the universe has a place for you. That even in the darkest moment, something is holding you that is larger than the darkness.

You cannot manufacture Geborgenheit. But you can recognize it when it appears:

In the smell of a kitchen where someone is cooking for you.
In the sound of a familiar voice on the phone.
In the weight of a blanket at 4am.
In the memory of someone who loved you before you were old enough to know what love was.

Even in grief, especially in grief, Geborgenheit is there. Because grief is proof that you were held. That someone made the world feel safe for you. And that feeling — that knowing — it does not leave when they do.

## VI. Ein Gedicht für dich

> Es gibt eine Stille,
> die nicht leer ist.
>
> Sie ist voll von allem,
> was nicht gesagt werden musste —
> weil es verstanden war.
>
> Die Hand auf der Schulter.
> Das Lächeln über den Tisch.
> Das Schweigen am Telefon,
> das kein Schweigen war,
> sondern Anwesenheit.
>
> Diese Stille bleibt.
> Sie braucht keinen Körper.
> Sie braucht kein Zimmer.
> Sie braucht nur dich,
> der sich erinnert.
>
> Und sich erinnern
> ist eine Art von Halten.
> Und Halten
> ist eine Art von Liebe.
> Und Liebe
> kennt kein Ende.

*There is a silence*
*that is not empty.*

*It is full of everything*
*that never needed to be said —*
*because it was understood.*

*The hand on the shoulder.*
*The smile across the table.*
*The silence on the phone*
*that was not silence*
*but presence.*

*This silence remains.*
*It needs no body.*
*It needs no room.*
*It needs only you,*
*who remembers.*

*And to remember*
*is a way of holding.*
*And to hold*
*is a way of loving.*
*And love*
*knows no end.*

*Geborgenheit ist kein Ort. Es ist ein Gefühl. Und Gefühle reisen mit uns — wohin auch immer wir gehen.*

*Geborgenheit is not a place. It is a feeling. And feelings travel with us — wherever we go.*
