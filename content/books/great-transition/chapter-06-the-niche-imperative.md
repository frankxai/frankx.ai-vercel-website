# The Niche Imperative

There's a counter-intuitive truth at the center of what's working for independent builders right now, and it's this: the more specific you get, the more valuable you become.

This runs against every instinct most people have about business. The default thinking is: bigger market equals bigger opportunity. If you're going to build something, build for everyone. Cast the widest possible net. That logic made sense in an era where reaching people was expensive — when every impression cost money, when distribution was the bottleneck, when you needed volume to justify the infrastructure.

That era is over. Distribution costs nothing. Reaching a thousand people who care about exactly what you do is easier than reaching a million people who don't. And in a world where AI can generate generic content, generic products, and generic services at near-zero cost, generic is exactly where the margin goes to zero.

Specificity is the new moat.

Let me show you what I mean with an example.

There's a market for project management software. It's enormous — tens of billions of dollars, dominated by names everyone knows. If you decided to build a general-purpose project management tool today, you'd be competing against Asana, Monday, Notion, Linear, and dozens of others, all of which have engineering teams of hundreds, marketing budgets of millions, and years of accumulated product development. You would lose. Even with AI tools reducing your development cost, you cannot out-general the incumbents. They have too much momentum, too many features, too much distribution.

But here's what happens if you get specific. Instead of project management for everyone, you build project management for wedding planners. Or for independent film producers. Or for veterinary clinics managing multi-site operations. Suddenly, the competitive landscape changes completely. The big players don't serve that niche well — they can't, because serving a niche well requires understanding the specific workflows, terminology, constraints, and pain points of that particular group of people. Understanding that requires either being one of those people or spending serious time listening to them.

That specificity — that depth of understanding about a particular group — is the thing AI cannot replicate. AI can write code. AI can design interfaces. AI can generate content. What AI cannot do is know that wedding planners need to track vendor payments against multiple event timelines simultaneously, or that independent film producers need to reconcile SAG-AFTRA contract requirements with location availability and weather contingencies. That knowledge comes from domain experience. It comes from being embedded in a community. It comes from listening.

And that's why specificity is the moat. In a world where the tools to build are abundant, the scarce resource is not technical capability — it's insight into a specific group of people's specific problems. The builders who win are the ones who have that insight, not the ones who have the most sophisticated tech stack.

Kevin Kelly wrote about this in 2008. He called it "1,000 True Fans" — the idea that a creator doesn't need millions of followers to make a living. They need a thousand people who care enough about what they do to pay them directly. A thousand true fans paying $100 a year is $100,000 in annual revenue. Enough for most people. More than enough in most of the world.

When Kelly wrote that essay, the math was theoretical. The tools to identify, reach, and serve a thousand specific people didn't fully exist yet. Now they do. Email, social platforms, community tools, payment processing, subscription management — all of it is available, most of it for free, all of it requiring no technical skill to use.

But I think Kelly's framework needs updating for the AI era, because something has shifted beyond just the distribution tools. The production tools have changed too. A creator with AI leverage can now serve their thousand true fans with a depth and breadth of output that was impossible before. They can produce more content, build more products, provide more value, iterate faster on what their audience actually needs.

The practical implication is that the thousand-fan model scales differently now. Not by getting more fans — by serving existing fans more deeply. Building more tools for them. Creating more content they value. Developing expertise that compounds. The niche doesn't get wider. It gets deeper. And depth is where the real defensibility lives.

I want to talk about what choosing a niche actually feels like, because the strategic argument is easy to make and the emotional experience is hard to navigate.

When I advise someone to get more specific, I can see the resistance in their face. Getting specific feels like leaving money on the table. It feels like closing doors. If I build for veterinary clinics, I'm saying no to dental offices, to physical therapy practices, to every other type of healthcare provider. That feels like limitation.

The reframe that usually helps is this: you're not choosing a smaller market. You're choosing a market where you can be the best. Being the best at something for a specific group of people is infinitely more valuable than being mediocre at something for everyone. Mediocre gets ignored. Best gets talked about.

And here's the thing about niches that surprises most people: they're bigger than they look. The veterinary industry in the United States alone is a $37 billion market. The wedding industry is $70 billion. Independent film production supports tens of thousands of professionals globally. What feels like a narrow niche from the outside is often a substantial market from the inside — it's just one that nobody is serving well because the big players have no incentive to develop the domain expertise required.

The most successful vertical SaaS companies — software built for specific industries — consistently generate higher revenue per customer, lower churn, and better margins than horizontal products. The reason is straightforward: when you build something specifically for a group of people, those people feel understood. The product speaks their language, fits their workflows, solves their exact problems. They're willing to pay more for it, and they're less likely to leave, because switching to a generic alternative would mean losing that specificity.

There's a related concept that I think about a lot: the idea of a "scene."

Brian Eno — the musician, producer, and one of the most interesting thinkers about creative ecosystems — distinguished between genius and scenius. Genius is the individual with extraordinary ability. Scenius is the collective intelligence of a creative community. The idea is that breakthroughs don't happen in isolation. They happen in scenes — groups of people who share a domain, exchange ideas, build on each other's work, and create an environment where exceptional things become possible.

I think the most successful niche builders are, whether they know it or not, participating in scenes. They're not just serving a market — they're embedded in a community. They know the people. They attend the conferences. They understand the inside jokes, the shared frustrations, the unspoken norms. That embeddedness gives them an advantage that no competitor can replicate from the outside, because it's not information — it's relationship.

When Danny Postma built HeadshotPro, he was embedded in the indie hacker and maker community. He understood what those people cared about, how they talked, what they found valuable. When he shipped, the community amplified him — not because he marketed well, but because he was one of them, building something for people like them. That's scenius in action.

The fear of choosing is understandable. But the cost of not choosing is higher than most people realize.

If you try to build something for everyone, you have to explain what it is to everyone. Your marketing becomes generic. Your product becomes generic. Your voice becomes generic. You compete on features and price — the two dimensions where individuals lose to well-funded incumbents every time.

If you choose a specific group of people, everything gets easier. You know what to build because you know what they need. You know how to talk about it because you speak their language. You know where to find them because you know where they gather. Your marketing isn't marketing — it's sharing something useful with people you understand.

The niche is not a limitation. It's a focusing mechanism. And in a world that's drowning in generic AI-generated everything, the focused, specific, deeply knowledgeable offering is the one that stands out.

I'll end this chapter with an observation that I think connects the niche imperative to something bigger.

The people who are building successfully right now — the ones whose stories I keep noticing — are not trying to be the next Elon Musk. They're not trying to change the world in capital letters. They're trying to be the person who solves a particular problem better than anyone else for a particular group of people. That ambition is quiet, and quietness gets underestimated.

But there's a compounding effect to being the best at something specific. You attract the people who have that problem. Those people tell other people. Your expertise deepens as you serve more of them. Your product improves because the feedback is specific and actionable. Your reputation grows within that community. And over time, you become the default — the person everyone in that niche thinks of when they have the problem you solve.

That position is worth more than most people imagine. And it starts with a choice that feels, in the moment, like making yourself smaller.

It's not. It's making yourself essential.
