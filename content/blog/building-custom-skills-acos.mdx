# Building Custom Skills for ACOS: The Complete Developer Guide

_Extend ACOS with your own domain expertise._

---

## TL;DR

ACOS skills are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter that teach Claude specialized knowledge. They follow the 500-line rule for progressive disclosure and auto-activate via `skill-rules.json`. This guide walks through creating a skill from scratch: anatomy, writing patterns, auto-activation rules, testing, and publishing. By the end, you'll have a working skill that loads automatically when needed.

---

## What Are ACOS Skills?

Skills are **domain knowledge modules** that load into Claude's context when relevant. Unlike prompts (one-time instructions), skills persist and auto-activate based on context.

**Example: The `suno-ai-mastery` Skill**

When you say "help me create a synthwave track," ACOS:

1. Detects keywords: "create", "track"
2. Checks `skill-rules.json` for matches
3. Finds rule: `suno-ai-mastery` triggers on music keywords
4. Loads the skill into context
5. Claude now has Suno-specific knowledge

You never typed `/skill suno-ai-mastery`. It just happened.

### Skills vs. Agents vs. Commands

| Component   | What It Is       | When It Loads              |
| ----------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Skill**   | Domain knowledge | Auto-activates on context  |
| **Agent**   | Persona/behavior | Invoked for specific tasks |
| **Command** | Entry point      | User types `/command`      |

Skills teach Claude _what to know_.
Agents tell Claude _how to behave_.
Commands are _how users invoke things_.

---

## The Skill File Anatomy

Every skill has two parts: **YAML frontmatter** and **Markdown content**.

```markdown
---
# YAML FRONTMATTER
name: my-skill-name
description: "What this skill does (1 sentence)"
version: "1.0.0"
author: "Your Name"
triggers:
  - keyword1
  - keyword2
  - keyword3
category: technical # or creative, business, personal, system
related_skills:
  - other-skill-1
  - other-skill-2
---

# MARKDOWN CONTENT

## Purpose

What this skill teaches Claude.

## When to Use

Specific scenarios where this skill applies.

## Core Patterns

The actual knowledge, with code examples.

## Anti-Patterns

What NOT to do.

## Examples

Real, working examples.
```

### The 500-Line Rule

No skill file should exceed 500 lines. This enables **progressive disclosure**:

```
Level 1: Frontmatter (~50 lines)
  → Claude scans to decide relevance

Level 2: Main content (~450 lines)
  → Core patterns and examples

Level 3: Resources folder (unlimited)
  → Deep reference material, loaded on demand
```

**Directory Structure:**

```
~/.claude/skills/your-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Core instructions (Level 1)
├── CLAUDE.md             # Auto-loaded context (Level 2)
└── resources/            # Deep references (Level 3)
    ├── examples.md
    ├── patterns.md
    └── advanced.md
```

# API Documentation Skill

## Purpose

This skill teaches Claude how to write API documentation that developers actually want to read. Focus on clarity, completeness, and practical examples.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when:

- Writing documentation for REST APIs
- Creating OpenAPI/Swagger specs
- Documenting endpoint behavior
- Writing API reference guides

## Core Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Endpoint Template

Every endpoint should document:

````markdown
## `POST /api/users`

Create a new user account.

### Request

**Headers:**
| Header | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `Authorization` | Yes | Bearer token |
| `Content-Type` | Yes | `application/json` |

**Body:**

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "role": "member"
}
```
````
````

**Parameters:**
| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `email` | string | Yes | Valid email address |
| `name` | string | Yes | Display name (2-100 chars) |
| `role` | string | No | Default: "member" |

### Response

**Success (201 Created):**

```json
{
  "id": "usr_abc123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "role": "member",
  "created_at": "2026-01-27T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Errors:**
| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 400 | Invalid request body |
| 409 | Email already exists |
| 401 | Invalid or missing token |

### Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/api/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "name": "John Doe"}'
```

````

### Pattern 2: Error Documentation

Always document errors with:
1. HTTP status code
2. Error code (if applicable)
3. Human-readable message
4. How to fix it

```markdown
## Errors

### 400 Bad Request

**When:** Request body is malformed or missing required fields.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid request body",
    "details": [
      {"field": "email", "issue": "Must be valid email format"}
    ]
  }
}
````

**Fix:** Check that all required fields are present and correctly formatted.

````

### Pattern 3: Authentication Section

```markdown
## Authentication

All API requests require a Bearer token in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
````

### Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.example.com)
2. Navigate to Settings → API Keys
3. Click "Generate New Key"
4. Copy the key (shown only once)

### Token Expiration

Tokens expire after 30 days. Refresh using:

```bash
POST /api/auth/refresh
```

```

## Anti-Patterns

### Don't: Assume Context

❌ Bad:
```

## Create User

Creates a user.

```

✅ Good:
```

## Create User

Creates a new user account in your organization.
The user will receive an email invitation to set their password.

```

### Don't: Skip Error Cases

❌ Bad: Only documenting the happy path
✅ Good: Every endpoint lists possible errors

### Don't: Use Placeholder Data

❌ Bad: `"id": "xxx"`
✅ Good: `"id": "usr_abc123"` (realistic format)

## Examples

### Complete Endpoint Documentation

[See resources/examples.md for full examples]

- `rest-api-design` - API design principles
```

### Step 3: Add Auto-Activation Rule

Edit `~/.claude/skill-rules.json`:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "skill": "api-documentation",
      "triggers": {
        "keywords": [
          "api docs",
          "api documentation",
          "document api",
          "endpoint",
          "swagger",
          "openapi"
        ],
        "filePatterns": ["**/api/**/*.md", "**/docs/api/**/*"],
        "commands": []
      },
      "priority": "medium",
      "maxConcurrent": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Test the Skill

```bash
# Open Claude Code
claude

# Say something that should trigger the skill
"Help me document this REST API endpoint for user creation"

# Claude should now have API documentation knowledge
```

## Skill Writing Best Practices

### 1. Start with "When to Use"

The first thing after Purpose should be explicit activation criteria:

```markdown
## When to Use

Activate this skill when:

- User mentions [specific keywords]
- Working with [specific file types]
- Task involves [specific domain]

Do NOT use when:

- [Situation where skill doesn't apply]
```

### 2. Use Real, Working Examples

Every pattern needs a complete, copy-paste-ready example:

````markdown
### Pattern: Rate Limiting Headers

❌ Abstract:
"Include rate limit headers in responses"

✅ Concrete:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1706356800
```
````

````

### 3. Include Anti-Patterns

Show what NOT to do. This prevents Claude from making common mistakes:

```markdown
## Anti-Patterns

### Don't: Over-Engineer Simple Endpoints

❌ Bad:
```typescript
class UserCreationRequestValidatorFactory {
  // 50 lines of abstraction
}
````

✅ Good:

```typescript
function validateUser(data) {
  // Direct validation
}
```

````

### 4. Link Related Skills

Help Claude know when to combine skills:

```markdown
## Related Skills

- `test-driven-development` - When writing tests for the API
- `security-best-practices` - For authentication patterns
- `typescript-patterns` - If using TypeScript SDK
````

### 5. Keep It Scannable

Use tables, code blocks, and bullet points. Claude (and humans) scan before reading:

```markdown
## Quick Reference

| Method | Endpoint     | Description    |
| ------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| GET    | `/users`     | List all users |
| POST   | `/users`     | Create user    |
| GET    | `/users/:id` | Get user by ID |
| PUT    | `/users/:id` | Update user    |
| DELETE | `/users/:id` | Delete user    |
```

---

## The skill-rules.json Deep Dive

The auto-activation system uses `skill-rules.json` with these properties:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "skill": "skill-name",
      "triggers": {
        "keywords": ["word1", "word2"],
        "filePatterns": ["**/*.tsx", "src/components/**/*"],
        "commands": ["/article-creator", "/spec"]
      },
      "priority": "high", // high, medium, low
      "maxConcurrent": 3 // Max skills loaded at once
    }
  ]
}
```

### Trigger Types

| Type           | How It Works                  | Example                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `keywords`     | Matches words in user message | `["react", "component", "hook"]` |
| `filePatterns` | Matches files being edited    | `["**/*.tsx", "**/*.jsx"]`       |
| `commands`     | Activates when command runs   | `["/spec", "/article-creator"]`  |

### Priority Levels

- **high**: Load immediately, even if at max concurrent
- **medium**: Load if under max concurrent limit
- **low**: Load only if no higher priority skills match

### Combining Triggers

Triggers are OR-based. Any match activates the skill:

```json
{
  "triggers": {
    "keywords": ["react"], // OR
    "filePatterns": ["*.tsx"], // OR
    "commands": ["/spec"] // Any of these triggers activation
  }
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if my skill loaded?

Check Claude's response. If it demonstrates specialized knowledge from your skill, it loaded. You can also ask "What skills are currently active?"

### Can skills conflict with each other?

Yes, if two skills give contradictory advice. Use `related_skills` to indicate which skills work together, and keep skills focused on single domains.

### How many skills can load at once?

Default is 3 concurrent skills (`maxConcurrent`). This prevents context overload while allowing skill combinations.

### Do skills persist across sessions?

Skills are loaded fresh each session based on context. Memory MCP persists knowledge; skills persist patterns.

### Can I use skills without ACOS?

Yes! Skills are just Claude Code skills. ACOS adds auto-activation and the curated library, but any skill works in base Claude Code.

### How do I debug a skill that won't load?

1. Check `skill-rules.json` syntax
2. Verify trigger keywords match your message
3. Check file path is correct
4. Try explicit `/skill skill-name` to force load
