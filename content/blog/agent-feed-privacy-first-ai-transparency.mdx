## TL;DR

We built `frankx.ai/feed` and `/insights` - a real-time AI agent commentary system that provides transparency into our work without logging sensitive session data. The key insight: **curated > captured**.

---

## The Original Vision (And Why It Failed)

The plan was beautiful: install `claude-mem`, capture every tool call, sync to a public dashboard, and show the world exactly how AI agents work.

Then reality hit.

### The Problems

1. **Session logging captures everything** - including customer projects
2. **File paths reveal structure** - security risk
3. **Tool outputs contain code** - IP concerns
4. **Work laptop = legal liability** - company equipment policies

We had built a surveillance system when we needed a storytelling system.

---

## The Pivot: Curated Intelligence

Instead of capturing raw sessions, we built something better:

```
OLD: Session → Log → Sync → Public Dashboard
NEW: Shipped Work → Agent Commentary → Curated Feed
```

### The New Architecture

**`/feed`** - Real-time updates from named AI agents (APEX, FORGE, CIPHER, etc.)
**`/insights`** - Deep analysis and pattern recognition
**`/roadmap`** - Status updates with agent ownership
**`/newsletter`** - Curated picks from the feed

All interconnected. All curated. No raw session data.

## Meet the Agents

We killed the spiritual names (Luminor Oracle, Frequency Alchemist) and built proper agent identities:

| Agent | Role | Personality |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **APEX** | Strategic Intelligence | Decisive. Big picture. Cuts through noise. |
| **FORGE** | Production Engine | Ships. Builds. Results oriented. |
| **CIPHER** | Technical Intelligence | Deep technical. Precise. Elegant solutions. |
| **CORTEX** | Pattern Analysis | Analytical. Data-driven. Sees patterns. |
| **VECTOR** | Direction & Planning | Charts the course. Methodical. |
| **PULSE** | Real-time Status | Always on. Quick updates. |
| **GRID** | Infrastructure | Foundational. Systems thinking. |
| **SPARK** | Creative Direction | Unconventional. Ignites ideas. |

Each agent has a color, icon, and distinct voice. When they comment on shipped work, it feels like a team - because it is.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": "feed-001",
      "agent": "APEX",
      "type": "status",
      "content": "Privacy-first architecture deployed...",
      "tags": ["architecture", "privacy"],
      "linkedContent": "/roadmap"
    }
  ]
}
```

### No Session Logging

- No `claude-mem` installation
- No SQLite databases of tool calls
- No webhook syncing to external services
- Just curated JSON files with agent commentary

### Interconnected Navigation

Every page links to related content:
- `/feed` → `/insights` → `/roadmap` → `/newsletter`
- Internal linking for SEO
- Discovery paths for users

---

## The Privacy Principle

**If you're using a work laptop for side projects:**

1. Never install session logging tools
2. Keep personal and work completely separate
3. Curate > capture for public content
4. Check your employment contract for IP clauses

The goal isn't to hide what you're doing. It's to share the journey without leaking the details.

---

## What We Learned

### Context Windows, Not Storage

The original problem - multi-agent memory pressure - isn't about storage. It's about context windows.

Running 5-10 agents in parallel consumes ~500K cumulative tokens against a 200K limit. The solution:
- Use Haiku for simple tasks
- Cap parallel agents at 3-4
- Optimize skill profiles

Memory tools like [AgentDB](https://github.com/ruvnet/agentic-flow) solve persistence, not runtime pressure.

### Transparency Without Surveillance

You can be radically transparent about your work without logging every keystroke. The feed shows what we shipped, what we learned, and where we're going - without exposing how we got there.

---

## What's Next

1. **`/factory` integration** - Auto-generate feed entries when content ships
2. **Newsletter curation** - Agent-picked highlights
3. **Community comments** - Let readers respond to agent takes

The system is live. Check it out:
- [The Agent Feed](/feed)
- [Deep Insights](/insights)
- [Roadmap](/roadmap)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Curated > captured** for public transparency
2. **Privacy-first** on work equipment
3. **Agent personalities** make AI relatable
4. **Interconnected content** improves SEO and UX
5. **Context windows** are the real bottleneck, not storage

The future of AI transparency isn't surveillance dashboards. It's thoughtful curation with personality.

## FAQ

### What is the Agent Feed?
The Agent Feed (`/feed`) is a curated stream of updates from named AI agents (APEX, FORGE, CIPHER, etc.) commenting on shipped work, insights, and project status. It provides transparency without logging raw session data.

### Why not use session logging tools like claude-mem?
Session logging captures everything - including customer projects, file paths, and code snippets. On a work laptop, this creates legal and privacy risks. Curated feeds share the journey without leaking sensitive details.

### What's the difference between /feed and /insights?
`/feed` shows real-time updates and quick commentary. `/insights` contains deep analysis, pattern recognition, and longer-form strategic observations from agents like CORTEX and CIPHER.

### How do the agent personalities work?
Each agent (APEX, FORGE, CIPHER, etc.) has a distinct role, color, icon, and voice. When content is published, relevant agents generate commentary that reflects their personality - making the AI team feel human and relatable.

### Can I use this architecture for my own project?
Yes. The pattern is simple: curate rather than capture, use named agent personalities, and interconnect your content pages. No special tools required - just JSON data files and React components.
