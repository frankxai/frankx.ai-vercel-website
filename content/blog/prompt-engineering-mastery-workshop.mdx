# The 5C Framework: Mastering Prompt Engineering for Any AI System

**TL;DR**: The 5C Framework (Context, Constraints, Command, Clarifications, Completion) transforms vague requests into precise prompts that get excellent results every time. This workshop is the foundation for all AI work.

---

## The Prompt Engineering Problem

Why do some people get amazing results from AI while others struggle?

| Novice Prompts | Engineered Prompts |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Vague requests | Precise instructions |
| Hit-or-miss | Consistent quality |
| Frustrating iterations | First-attempt success |

The difference isn't the AI. It's the prompt.

## The 5C Framework

Every effective prompt contains these five components:

### 1. Context
Background information the AI needs.

```markdown
BAD:  "Write some code"

GOOD: "I'm a senior developer working on a Node.js
       microservice that handles payment processing.
       Our stack includes Express, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL."
```

### 2. Constraints
Rules and boundaries.

```markdown
"Requirements:
 - TypeScript strict mode
 - No external dependencies
 - Error handling for all edge cases
 - Unit test coverage >80%"
```

### 3. Command
The actual request.

```markdown
"Create a POST endpoint at /api/payments/process
 that accepts {amount, currency, customerId}
 and returns {transactionId, status, timestamp}"
```

### 4. Clarifications
Edge cases and preferences.

```markdown
"Edge cases:
 - Invalid currency → return 400
 - Customer not found → return 404
 - Insufficient funds → return 402"
```

### 5. Completion
Output format.

```markdown
"Output:
 1. Implementation code
 2. Type definitions
 3. Example curl command
 4. Unit test example"
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

```markdown
"Think through this step by step:
1. Analyze the current implementation
2. Identify potential issues
3. Propose improvements
4. Implement the solution
5. Verify it works"
```

### Few-Shot Learning

```markdown
"Convert function names to kebab-case:

getUserById → get-user-by-id
createNewPost → create-new-post

Now convert:
fetchAllProducts →"
```

### Role Prompting

```markdown
"You are a senior security engineer.
 Analyze this code for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities."
```

## Workshop Modules

1. **Fundamentals** - How LLMs process prompts
2. **5C Framework** - The systematic approach
3. **Advanced Techniques** - CoT, Few-Shot, Roles
4. **Domain-Specific** - Code, review, debugging
5. **Template Building** - Your prompt library
6. **Multi-Turn** - Extended conversations

## Build Your Template Library

The workshop helps you create:

- 5 code generation templates
- 3 code review templates
- 3 documentation templates
- 3 debugging templates
- 5 domain-specific templates

All personalized to your workflow.
