# Production LLMs and AI Agents on OCI: Agent Patterns That Actually Scale

**TL;DR:** Enterprises typically land in one of two agent patterns: managed runtime (OCI AI Agent Platform/Agent Hub) for speed and consistency, or framework runtime (LangGraph/LangChain on OKE) for maximum control. Many organizations use both. This post helps you decide when to use which.

---

## Two Production Paths: Managed vs Framework Agents

Both patterns are valid. The key is being explicit about which you're choosing—and why—before you start building.

### Path A: Managed Agent Runtime (Fastest to Value)

Use **OCI AI Agent Platform** and **Agent Hub** as your orchestration layer.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Speed to deployment | Less control over internal logic |
| Managed scaling and infrastructure | Vendor-specific patterns |
| Consistent platform to onboard teams | May require workarounds for edge cases |
| Built-in security and compliance | Tool limitations early in platform maturity |

**Best when:** You want speed, managed scaling, and a consistent platform to onboard multiple teams.

### Path B: Framework Agent Runtime (Maximum Control)

Run **LangGraph/LangChain-style services** on OCI compute (OKE, Container Instances).

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Full control over agent logic | You own the infrastructure |
| Custom workflows and state machines | More DevOps overhead |
| Framework ecosystem (tools, integrations) | Consistency depends on your standards |
| Portable across clouds | Security is your responsibility |

**Best when:** You need custom workflows, bespoke tool execution, or deep integration into existing platforms.

### The Hybrid Reality

In practice, many organizations use **both**:
- **Managed agents** for broad internal productivity and customer-facing assistants
- **Framework agents** for specialized workflows where you need tight control

## OCI AI Agent Platform: What You Get

### Built-In Integrations
- **Oracle Databases** (Autonomous DB, MySQL HeatWave)
- **Object Storage** for document retrieval
- **OCI Functions** for custom tasks
- **Oracle Digital Assistant** for conversation management

### Agent Hub: The Control Center
- Create, deploy, and govern agents centrally
- Register multiple specialized agents
- Meta-agents route requests to the appropriate agent
- Abstracts complexity of navigating many agents

### Built-In Tools

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **SQL Tool** | Execute database queries with self-correction |
| **RAG Tool** | Document retrieval with hybrid semantic search |
| **Custom Tool** | Backed by OCI Functions or any API |

## Framework Agents on OCI: LangGraph/LangChain

### Why LangGraph?

- **Stateful graphs** for complex multi-step workflows
- **Branching and cycles** (not just linear chains)
- **Human-in-the-loop** patterns built-in
- **Persistence** for long-running tasks
- **Streaming** for responsive UX

### Deployment on OKE

```yaml
# Example Helm values
replicaCount: 3
image:
  repository: <region>.ocir.io/<tenancy>/agent-service
  tag: "v1.2.0"
env:
  - name: OCI_GENAI_ENDPOINT
    value: "https://inference.generativeai.<region>.oci.oraclecloud.com"
```

## Tool Standardization: The Secret to Scaling

### Tool Design Principles

1. **Single responsibility**: One tool, one job
2. **Clear schemas**: Input/output types the LLM can understand
3. **Error handling**: Fail gracefully with useful messages
4. **Observability built-in**: Every tool call emits telemetry

### Tool Registry

Maintain a versioned catalog of all tools:
- Tool name and version
- Input/output schema
- Permissions required
- Data classification
- Owner and support contact

## Decision Framework: Managed vs Framework

| Factor | Choose Managed | Choose Framework |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Time to production** | < 4 weeks | Can invest 8+ weeks |
| **Team expertise** | Limited LLM experience | Strong Python skills |
| **Customization** | Standard patterns work | Unique workflows required |
| **Scale** | 10s of agents | 100s of specialized agents |
| **Compliance** | Need managed controls | Can implement own |
| **Multi-cloud** | OCI-centric | Portability required |

Most enterprises: **managed for 80%** of use cases, **framework for the 20%** that need custom control.
