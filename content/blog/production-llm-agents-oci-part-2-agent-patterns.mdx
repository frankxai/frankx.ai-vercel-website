# Production LLMs and AI Agents on OCI: Six Agent Orchestration Patterns

**TL;DR**: Not all agent workflows are equal. This pattern library maps six orchestration patterns to OCI services, with explicit decision criteria for each. Match your workflow requirements to the right pattern before you write a single line of code.

---

## The Pattern Selection Problem

Most teams pick an orchestration pattern based on what they saw in a tutorial, not what their workflow actually requires.

This leads to:
- **Over-engineering**: Building complex multi-agent systems for simple linear workflows
- **Under-engineering**: Using linear chains when concurrent or collaborative patterns would dramatically improve quality
- **Wrong abstraction**: Fighting the pattern instead of leveraging it

The solution: **Pattern-first design**. Understand your workflow characteristics, then select the pattern that fits.

## Pattern 1: Sequential Orchestration

**Definition**: Chains agents in a predefined linear order. Each agent processes the output from the previous agent, creating a pipeline of specialized transformations.

<DecisionBox title="Sequential Pattern">

**Flow**: Agent 1 (Extract) → Agent 2 (Analyze) → Agent 3 (Draft) → Agent 4 (Review)

<ComparisonGrid>
  <ComparisonCard title="Characteristics" color="cyan">
    Fixed order, predictable flow. Each stage adds specific value. State accumulates through pipeline. Easy to debug with linear trace.
  </ComparisonCard>
  <ComparisonCard title="Best For" color="emerald">
    Document processing pipelines, content generation workflows, sequential transformations where order matters.
  </ComparisonCard>
</ComparisonGrid>

</DecisionBox>

### When to Use Sequential

| Use When | Avoid When |
|----------|------------|
| Stages have clear linear dependencies | Stages can be parallelized |
| Each stage adds specific value for the next | Single agent can handle the full task |
| Workflow progression is predictable | Workflow requires backtracking |
| Performance of each stage is well-understood | Agents need to collaborate dynamically |

### OCI Implementation

| Component | OCI Service | Configuration |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Runtime** | OCI AI Agent Platform | Workflow definition with sequential steps |
| **State** | Autonomous JSON DB | Document state accumulates across stages |
| **Orchestration** | OKE + LangGraph | `StateGraph` with linear edges |
| **Monitoring** | OCI APM | Trace spans for each stage |

### Example: Contract Generation Pipeline

<DecisionBox title="Contract Generation Workflow">

**Pipeline Stages:**

1. **Template Selection** — Select appropriate contract template based on deal parameters
2. **Clause Customization** — Customize standard clauses based on negotiated terms
3. **Regulatory Compliance** — Review against applicable laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
4. **Risk Assessment** — Analyze liability exposure, dispute resolution, termination clauses

**OCI Services:**
- **Agent Platform**: Workflow orchestration
- **OCI Generative AI**: Cohere Command R+ for legal reasoning
- **Autonomous DB 23ai**: Contract templates + clause library
- **Object Storage**: Generated contract documents

</DecisionBox>

---

## Pattern 2: Concurrent Orchestration

**Definition**: Runs multiple agents simultaneously on the same task. Each agent provides independent analysis from its unique perspective. Results are aggregated for final output.

<DecisionBox title="Concurrent Pattern">

**Flow**: Input → [Agent A + Agent B + Agent C running in parallel] → Aggregate Results → Output

<ComparisonGrid>
  <ComparisonCard title="Characteristics" color="violet">
    Parallel execution reduces latency. Multiple independent perspectives. Requires aggregation strategy. Best for ensemble reasoning.
  </ComparisonCard>
  <ComparisonCard title="Best For" color="emerald">
    Investment analysis, multi-perspective reviews, brainstorming, time-sensitive scenarios where speed matters.
  </ComparisonCard>
</ComparisonGrid>

</DecisionBox>

### When to Use Concurrent

| Use When | Avoid When |
|----------|------------|
| Tasks can run in parallel | Agents need to build on each other's work |
| Multiple perspectives improve quality | Deterministic, reproducible results required |
| Time-sensitive scenarios | Resource constraints limit parallelization |
| Brainstorming, ensemble decisions | Conflict resolution logic is too complex |

### OCI Implementation

| Component | OCI Service | Configuration |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Runtime** | OKE with parallel pods | Each agent in separate pod |
| **Orchestration** | LangGraph parallel nodes | `parallel_branch` construct |
| **Aggregation** | OCI Functions | Weighted voting, consensus logic |
| **Monitoring** | OCI APM | Parallel span tracking |

### Example: Investment Analysis

<DecisionBox title="Investment Analysis Workflow">

**Input**: Stock ticker + analysis request

<ComparisonGrid>
  <ComparisonCard title="Fundamental Agent" color="cyan">
    P/E ratios, revenue growth, DCF valuation, balance sheet analysis
  </ComparisonCard>
  <ComparisonCard title="Technical Agent" color="violet">
    RSI, MACD, support/resistance levels, chart patterns
  </ComparisonCard>
</ComparisonGrid>

<ComparisonGrid>
  <ComparisonCard title="Sentiment Agent" color="emerald">
    News analysis, social media sentiment, analyst reports
  </ComparisonCard>
  <ComparisonCard title="ESG Agent" color="amber">
    Environmental impact, governance quality, social responsibility
  </ComparisonCard>
</ComparisonGrid>

**Aggregator**: Weighted combine → Confidence score → Final Recommendation

**OCI Services:**
- **OKE**: 4 parallel pods for each agent
- **OCI Generative AI**: Llama 3.3 70B for analysis
- **Autonomous DB 23ai**: Historical data + embeddings
- **OCI Functions**: Aggregation logic

</DecisionBox>

## Pattern 3: Group Chat Orchestration

**Definition**: Multiple agents solve problems through shared conversation threads. A chat manager coordinates flow, determining which agents respond and when.

<DecisionBox title="Group Chat Pattern">

**Example Thread** — "Design a park for the downtown district":

- **[Community Agent]**: "Based on resident surveys, families want playgrounds..."
- **[Environment Agent]**: "The soil analysis shows native plants would thrive..."
- **[Budget Agent]**: "Construction costs estimate $2.3M for Phase 1..."
- **[Community Agent]**: "Addressing the budget concern, we could phase..."

**Chat Manager** coordinates: Select speaker → Manage turns → Detect completion

<ComparisonGrid>
  <ComparisonCard title="Characteristics" color="amber">
    Collaborative problem-solving. Iterative refinement through discussion. Chat manager controls flow. Best limited to 3 agents to prevent loops.
  </ComparisonCard>
  <ComparisonCard title="Best For" color="emerald">
    Creative brainstorming, multidisciplinary problems, iterative refinement, quality control with maker-checker loops.
  </ComparisonCard>
</ComparisonGrid>

</DecisionBox>

### When to Use Group Chat

| Use When | Avoid When |
|----------|------------|
| Creative brainstorming with multiple perspectives | Simple task delegation suffices |
| Iterative refinement through discussion | Real-time processing required |
| Quality control with maker-checker loops | Clear hierarchical decision-making |
| Multidisciplinary problems | Chat manager can't determine completion |

### OCI Implementation

| Component | OCI Service | Configuration |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Runtime** | OCI AI Agent Platform | Multi-agent conversation |
| **Chat Manager** | OCI Functions | Turn selection logic |
| **Message Store** | Autonomous JSON DB | Conversation history |
| **Monitoring** | Logging Analytics | Full conversation audit |

### Maker-Checker Variant

A common group chat pattern where one agent creates and another validates:

<DecisionBox title="Maker-Checker Pattern">

**Loop**: Create → Critique → Revise → Approve

<ComparisonGrid>
  <ComparisonCard title="Maker Agent" subtitle="Llama 3.3 70B" color="cyan">
    Generates code implementation. Addresses feedback from checker. Iterates until approved.
  </ComparisonCard>
  <ComparisonCard title="Checker Agent" subtitle="Cohere Command R+" color="violet">
    Reviews for bugs, security, style. Provides specific feedback. Approves or requests changes.
  </ComparisonCard>
</ComparisonGrid>

**OCI Services:**
- **AI Agent Platform**: Both agents in same workflow
- **OCI Generative AI**: Different models optimized for each role
- **Autonomous DB**: Store iterations for learning

</DecisionBox>

## Pattern 4: Handoff Orchestration

**Definition**: Enables dynamic delegation between specialized agents. Each agent assesses whether to handle the task directly or transfer to a more appropriate agent based on context.

<DecisionBox title="Handoff Pattern">

**Flow**: User Request → Triage Agent → Routes to Specialist

<ComparisonGrid>
  <ComparisonCard title="Technical Agent" color="cyan">
    Handles technical issues. Can handoff to Billing if billing issue detected.
  </ComparisonCard>
  <ComparisonCard title="Billing Agent" color="violet">
    Handles payment, refunds, charges. Can escalate to Human Support.
  </ComparisonCard>
</ComparisonGrid>

<ComparisonGrid>
  <ComparisonCard title="Account Agent" color="emerald">
    Handles profile, settings, access issues.
  </ComparisonCard>
  <ComparisonCard title="Human Support" color="amber">
    Escalation path for complex or sensitive issues.
  </ComparisonCard>
</ComparisonGrid>

**Characteristics**: Dynamic routing based on context. One agent active at a time. Full control transfers on handoff. Prevents expertise mismatch.

</DecisionBox>

### When to Use Handoff

| Use When | Avoid When |
|----------|------------|
| Specialized knowledge required dynamically | Appropriate agent known upfront |
| Expertise requirements emerge during processing | Simple rule-based routing suffices |
| Multiple domains but one at a time | Multiple agents needed concurrently |
| Logical signals indicate capability limits | Risk of infinite handoff loops |

### OCI Implementation

| Component | OCI Service | Configuration |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Runtime** | OCI AI Agent Platform | Agent-to-agent routing |
| **Router** | OCI Functions | Handoff decision logic |
| **State** | Autonomous JSON DB | Conversation context persists |
| **Escalation** | Oracle Digital Assistant | Human handoff integration |

### Example: Customer Service Escalation

<DecisionBox title="Customer Service Handoff Workflow">

**Customer**: "My internet is slow and I was overcharged"

**1. Triage Agent** — Analyzes intent, detects both Technical and Billing issues

**2. Technical Agent** — "Let me check your connection..."
- Runs diagnostics via MCP tool
- Identifies router issue, resolves it
- **Handoff signal**: "Technical resolved. Billing issue detected."

**3. Billing Agent** (automatic handoff) — "I see the overcharge. Processing refund now..."
- **Resolution**: Issues $15.50 credit

**OCI Services:**
- **Agent Platform**: Multi-agent workflow with handoff rules
- **MCP Server on OKE**: Network diagnostic tools
- **Autonomous DB**: Customer account data
- **OCI Functions**: Billing system integration

</DecisionBox>

## Pattern 5: Orchestrator-Worker

**Definition**: A manager agent dynamically builds a task ledger with goals and subgoals, invoking specialized worker agents as needed. The plan evolves as context changes.

<DecisionBox title="Orchestrator-Worker Pattern">

**Orchestrator Agent** maintains a dynamic **Task Ledger**:

| Goal | Status |
|------|--------|
| Goal 1: Restore service availability | ✅ DONE |
| Goal 2: Identify root cause | 🔄 IN PROGRESS |
| └─ Subgoal 2a: Analyze logs | ✅ DONE |
| └─ Subgoal 2b: Check database | ⏳ PENDING |
| Goal 3: Implement fix | ⏳ PENDING |

<ComparisonGrid>
  <ComparisonCard title="Diagnostics Worker" color="cyan">
    Logging Analytics queries, APM trace analysis, error pattern detection
  </ComparisonCard>
  <ComparisonCard title="Infrastructure Worker" color="violet">
    OKE scaling, DB config changes, resource provisioning
  </ComparisonCard>
</ComparisonGrid>

**Characteristics**: Plan evolves as context changes. Workers have tools to affect external systems. Full audit trail via task ledger. Best for open-ended, complex problems.

</DecisionBox>

### When to Use Orchestrator-Worker

| Use When | Avoid When |
|----------|------------|
| Complex problems without predetermined solution | Solution path is deterministic |
| Multiple specialists needed to develop valid plan | No requirement for documented plan |
| Plan review required before/after implementation | Time-sensitive (pattern focuses on planning) |
| Agents interact with external systems | Low complexity where simpler patterns suffice |

### OCI Implementation

| Component | OCI Service | Configuration |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Orchestrator** | LangGraph on OKE | Dynamic subgraph spawning |
| **Task Ledger** | Autonomous JSON DB | Real-time plan updates |
| **Workers** | OCI AI Agent Platform | Specialized agents with tools |
| **Tools** | MCP Servers on OKE | External system integration |
| **Audit** | OCI Audit + Logging | Complete decision trail |

### Example: SRE Incident Response

<DecisionBox title="SRE Incident Response Workflow">

**Alert**: "Service latency > 5s for 10 minutes"

**Phase 1 — Orchestrator** creates initial plan:
- Goal: Restore service availability
- Goal: Identify root cause
- Invokes: **Diagnostics Worker**

**Phase 2 — Diagnostics Worker** investigates:
- Tools: Logging Analytics query, APM trace analysis
- **Finding**: "Database connection pool exhausted"

**Phase 3 — Orchestrator Updates Plan**:
- Goal: Restore service → **Subgoal**: Increase DB connection pool [NEW]
- Goal: Identify root cause → **Subgoal**: Trace connection leak source [NEW]
- Goal: Prevent recurrence [NEW]
- Invokes: **Infrastructure Worker**

**Phase 4 — Infrastructure Worker** remediates:
- Actions: Increased max_connections 100 → 200, Scaled OKE replicas 3 → 5
- **Result**: Latency restored to < 200ms

**OCI Services:**
- **LangGraph on OKE**: Orchestrator runtime
- **Agent Platform**: Worker agents
- **Autonomous DB**: Connection pool target
- **Logging Analytics + APM**: Diagnostics
- **OCI Audit**: Complete incident audit trail

</DecisionBox>

## Pattern 6: Human-in-the-Loop

**Definition**: Explicit breakpoints where human approval is required before the workflow continues. Critical for high-stakes decisions.

<DecisionBox title="Human-in-the-Loop Pattern">

**Flow**: Agent A (Process) → Agent B (Draft) → **HUMAN CHECKPOINT** → Agent C (Execute)

<ComparisonGrid>
  <ComparisonCard title="✅ Approve" color="emerald">
    Human approves the draft. Workflow continues to Agent C for execution.
  </ComparisonCard>
  <ComparisonCard title="❌ Reject + Feedback" color="amber">
    Human provides feedback. Workflow returns to Agent B for revision.
  </ComparisonCard>
</ComparisonGrid>

**Characteristics**: Async approval with timeout. Multiple approval tiers possible. Feedback loop for rejected items. Complete audit trail of all decisions.

</DecisionBox>

### When to Use Human-in-the-Loop

| Use When | Avoid When |
|----------|------------|
| High-stakes decisions (financial, legal, medical) | All decisions can be automated |
| Compliance requires human approval | Approval latency is unacceptable |
| Building trust in AI system | Volume makes human review impossible |
| Training data collection | Clear rules can replace judgment |

### OCI Implementation

| Component | OCI Service | Configuration |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Approval UI** | OCI APEX | Approval queue with context |
| **State Persistence** | Autonomous JSON DB | Workflow paused state |
| **Notifications** | OCI Notifications | Slack, email, SMS alerts |
| **Timeout** | OCI Events + Functions | Auto-escalate on timeout |
| **Audit** | OCI Audit | All approval decisions logged |

### Checkpoint Placement Strategy

| Checkpoint Type | When Required | Risk Tier |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------|
| Content approval | Before external publish | 🔴 HIGH |
| Financial action | Before payment/transfer | 🔴 HIGH |
| PII handling | Before processing personal data | 🔴 HIGH |
| External API call | Before irreversible action | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| Budget threshold | When cost > $X | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| Bulk operation | Before affecting >N records | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| Model selection | Before using new model | 🟢 LOW |

<Callout type="warning">
**Anti-Pattern: Too Many Checkpoints** — Checkpoint fatigue leads to rubber-stamping. Approval backlog blocks workflows. User trust in AI never builds.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
**Solution: Risk-tiered checkpoints** — HIGH risk: Always require approval. MEDIUM risk: Approve if confidence > 95%. LOW risk: Notify but don't block.
</Callout>
