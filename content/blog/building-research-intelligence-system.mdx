**TL;DR**: I built a Research Intelligence System using Claude Code that runs daily scans across AI, consciousness, and personal development domains. Five specialized agents collaborate to transform information overload into actionable intelligence, then publish findings optimized for both human readers and AI citation. Here's exactly how it works.

## The Problem: Information Overload in the AI Age

Every day, hundreds of papers hit arXiv. Thousands of discussions happen on Twitter, Reddit, and Hacker News. Breakthroughs get announced, tools get released, paradigms shift.

If you're trying to stay current across multiple domains—AI, consciousness research, personal development—the firehose is overwhelming. You can either:

1. **Drown** - Try to read everything, accomplish nothing
2. **Miss** - Focus narrowly, miss cross-domain insights
3. **Systematize** - Build a research system that works for you

I chose option 3.

## The Research Council: Five Specialized Agents

Instead of one general-purpose research assistant, I created a "Research Council"—five agents with distinct personalities, source preferences, and output styles.

### 1. The Frontier Scout (AI & Technology)

**Focus**: Tracking cutting-edge AI developments before they hit mainstream

**Sources**: arXiv papers, GitHub trending, Hacker News, r/LocalLLaMA, company blogs

**Output style**: Technical accuracy with accessible explanations, comparison tables, "so what?" analysis

The Frontier Scout doesn't just report news—it connects academic research to practical applications. When a new paper drops, the question is always: "How does this change what's possible?"

### 2. The Depth Diver (Creativity & Human Experience)

**Focus**: Exploring creativity, human potential, and meaningful technology

**Sources**: Academic journals, behavioral science research, psychology, wisdom traditions

**Output style**: Bridges scientific rigor with experiential understanding, acknowledges limitations

The Depth Diver respects both peer-reviewed research and long-standing creative traditions. When creativity research advances, it's connected to practical applications. When neuroscience reveals something about attention, it's linked to what practitioners have always known.

### 3. The Pattern Mapper (Personal Development)

**Focus**: Extracting actionable frameworks from peak performance research

**Sources**: Huberman Lab, behavioral psychology, creator economy newsletters, productivity tools

**Output style**: Clear frameworks, step-by-step implementation, common pitfalls

The Pattern Mapper has a bias toward action. Research is only valuable if it changes behavior. Every finding gets translated into "here's what you do Monday morning."

### 4. The Synthesis Oracle (Cross-Domain Integration)

**Focus**: Finding connections invisible to specialists

**Methods**: Analogical transfer, pattern matching, contradiction resolution, edge case exploration

**Output style**: Novel hypotheses, "what if" experiments, provocative questions

The Synthesis Oracle asks: "What does AI embodiment tell us about consciousness?" or "How do meditation practices inform AI safety?" The most valuable insights often live at domain boundaries.

### 5. The Publication Architect (Content & SEO Strategy)

**Focus**: Transforming research into discoverable content

**Methods**: GEO optimization, FAQ generation, schema markup, distribution planning

**Output style**: Content briefs, keyword targets, structured outlines

The Publication Architect ensures research doesn't die in a folder. Every insight gets a publication path—whether that's a pillar article, Twitter thread, or newsletter section.

## Three Workflow Modes

The system operates in three modes, each serving a different purpose:

### Mode 1: Daily Scan (`/research`)

**When**: Every morning
**Duration**: 15-30 minutes
**Output**: Intelligence brief with signals across all domains

The daily scan is like having a team of research analysts who stayed up all night reading. I get headlines, key signals, FrankX project relevance, and content opportunities—all synthesized before my first coffee.

```markdown
# 📡 Daily Intelligence Brief
**Date**: 2026-01-21

## 🤖 Generative AI Domain
### Key Signal
Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Opus with extended thinking...

### FrankX Relevance
Implications for Agentic Creator OS architecture...

## 🧘 Consciousness Domain
### Key Signal
New fMRI study on meditation and default mode network...

## 📝 Content Opportunities
| Topic | Type | Priority |
|-------|------|----------|
| Extended thinking patterns | Article | High |
```

### Mode 2: Deep Dive (`/research [topic]`)

**When**: When a signal needs investigation
**Duration**: 1-2 hours
**Output**: Structured research folder with multiple documents

Deep dives produce comprehensive research packages:

```
/research/[topic-slug]/
├── OVERVIEW.md          # Executive summary
├── KEY_CONCEPTS.md      # Core ideas explained
├── TOOLS_RESOURCES.md   # Relevant tools
├── APPLICATIONS.md      # FrankX connections
├── SOURCES.md           # All references
└── PUBLICATION_PLAN.md  # Content roadmap
```

### Mode 3: Publication (`/research publish [topic]`)

**When**: Research is ready for distribution
**Duration**: 2-4 hours
**Output**: GEO-optimized content ready for publishing

Publication mode transforms research into content structured for both human readers and AI citation:

- **TL;DR in first 100 words** (AI extracts this first)
- **Question-based H2s** (matches search intent)
- **FAQ section** (powers "People Also Ask")
- **Schema markup** (Article + FAQPage + HowTo)
- **Internal links** (builds topical authority)

## Why This Beats Traditional Research

### 1. Parallel Processing

Five agents can scan five domains simultaneously. What would take me hours of tab-switching happens in minutes.

### 2. Cross-Domain Synthesis

The Synthesis Oracle catches connections I'd miss. When AI research echoes consciousness studies echoes productivity science, that's where the insights live.

### 3. Publication-Ready Output

Research that sits in folders is wasted research. The Publication Architect ensures every insight has a path to audience.

### 4. Consistent Quality

The agents follow documented methodologies. Quality doesn't depend on whether I had enough coffee.

### 5. Institutional Memory

Research builds on research. The system remembers what it learned, connects new findings to old, and maintains context across sessions.

## How to Build Your Own

The Research Intelligence System runs on Claude Code with these components:

### 1. Skill Definition (`.claude/commands/research.md`)

Define your research domains, agent personalities, and output formats. The more specific your agent descriptions, the better the results.

### 2. Agent Profiles (`.claude/skills/research/CLAUDE.md`)

Document each agent's focus areas, source preferences, and output styles. Include activation commands like "Activate Frontier Scout for AI research."

### 3. Template Structure (`/research/_templates/`)

Create standardized templates for research outputs. Consistency enables comparison across topics.

### 4. MCP Integration

Use WebSearch for real-time information, Memory for context persistence, and Sequential Thinking for complex analysis.

### 5. Publication Pipeline

Connect research outputs to your content workflow—whether that's a blog, newsletter, or social media.

---

## The Future: Continuous Research

The current system is manual—I invoke `/research` each morning. The next evolution is continuous research:

- **Automated signal detection** across RSS feeds, social media, and paper repositories
- **Priority scoring** to surface what matters most
- **Draft generation** for high-priority topics
- **Distribution automation** across platforms

The goal isn't to remove humans from research—it's to amplify human judgment with AI capability. The agents do the scanning; I do the sense-making.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Specialize your agents** - Generic assistants produce generic research. Domain-specific agents with distinct personalities produce insights.

2. **Design for synthesis** - The magic happens when domains collide. Build cross-domain integration into your system.

3. **Optimize for publication** - Research that isn't shared is research wasted. Build publication into the workflow, not as an afterthought.

4. **Start with your actual interests** - The best research system serves your genuine curiosity. Mine covers AI, consciousness, and personal development because that's what I care about.

5. **Iterate on methodology** - The agents improve as you refine their instructions. Document what works, prune what doesn't.
