## What Are AI Coding Agents?

AI coding agents are more than chatbots that write code. They are autonomous systems that can:

- **Read and understand** your entire codebase
- **Execute commands** in your terminal
- **Write, edit, and refactor** code across multiple files
- **Search the web** for documentation and solutions
- **Connect to external tools** via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Unlike simple code completion tools, agents can handle complex, multi-step tasks like "refactor the authentication system to use JWT" or "set up a new API endpoint with tests and documentation."

## The AI Coding Agent Landscape

### Major Players in 2026

| Agent | Creator | Best For | License |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | Anthropic | Official Claude integration, best MCP support | Proprietary |
| **OpenCode** | Community | Customization, open-source, extensibility | Open Source |
| **Cline** | Community | VS Code users, visual feedback | Open Source |
| **Roo Code** | Community | Multi-model experimentation | Open Source |
| **Kilo Code** | Community | Lightweight, quick tasks | Open Source |

### How Agents Work

Every coding agent follows a similar architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    AI CODING AGENT                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                          │
│   ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐         │
│   │ PERCEIVE │───>│  REASON  │───>│   ACT    │         │
│   │          │    │          │    │          │         │
│   │ Read code│    │ Understand│   │ Write    │         │
│   │ See files│    │ Plan     │    │ Execute  │         │
│   │ Get input│    │ Decide   │    │ Modify   │         │
│   └──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘         │
│        │                                │               │
│        └────────────────────────────────┘               │
│                    FEEDBACK LOOP                        │
│                                                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The agent perceives your request and codebase, reasons about the best approach, takes action, and uses feedback to refine its work.

## Getting Started with Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, offering the tightest integration with Claude models and the best MCP support.

### Installation

```bash
# Install via npm
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Or with Bun (faster)
bun install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Set your API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Start Claude Code
claude
```

### First Steps

Once installed, try these commands:

```bash
# Start in a project directory
cd your-project
claude

# Inside Claude Code
> "What is this project about?"
> "Find all TODO comments in the codebase"
> "Write tests for the utils.ts file"
```

### Essential Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/help` | Show all available commands |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation history |

| `/model` | Switch between Claude models |
| `/mcp` | Manage MCP server connections |

---

## Setting Up OpenCode

OpenCode is the leading open-source alternative, offering extensive customization through its plugin system and oh-my-opencode extensions.

### Installation

```bash
# Via npm
npm install -g @opencode-ai/cli

# From source for maximum control
git clone https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode
cd opencode
bun install
bun link
```

### Configuration

Create `.opencode/config.yaml` in your project:

```yaml
version: "1.0"

model:
  provider: anthropic
  name: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
  temperature: 0.7

project:
  include:
    - "src/**/*.ts"
    - "*.md"
  exclude:
    - "node_modules"
    - ".git"

permissions:
  fileWrite: prompt
  shellExec: prompt
```

### Oh-My-OpenCode

The community extension pack supercharges OpenCode:

```bash
opencode plugin install oh-my-opencode
```

This adds:
- Enhanced git integration
- Code review automation
- Project scaffolding templates
- Custom prompts library

## The Evolution Framework

The key to mastering AI coding agents is understanding the evolution from basic usage to full orchestration.

### Level 0: Basic Prompts

Where everyone starts:

```
> "Write a function to validate email"
> "Fix the bug on line 45"
```

**Limitations**: No persistent context, agent doesn't know your patterns.

### Level 1: CLAUDE.md - Project Context

Your first evolution. Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root:

```markdown
# My Project

## Overview
This is a Next.js 15 e-commerce platform.

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle

## Conventions
- Functional components only
- Tests in __tests__ folders
- Use pnpm

## Current Focus
Working on checkout flow.
```

Now the agent understands your project context in every conversation.

### Level 2: skill.md - Domain Expertise

Package your knowledge into reusable skills:

```markdown
# TypeScript Best Practices

## Core Principles

### Strict Mode Always
Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json.

### Use Type Guards
function isUser(value: unknown): value is User {
  return typeof value === 'object' && 'name' in value;
}

## When to Use
- Writing new TypeScript code
- Reviewing TypeScript PRs
```

Skills let you consistently apply expertise across projects.

### Level 3: agent.md - Agent Personas

Create specialized agents with distinct behaviors:

```markdown
# Code Reviewer Agent

## Identity
You are a meticulous senior code reviewer.

## Personality
- Thorough but not pedantic
- Explains the "why" behind suggestions
- Prioritizes critical issues

## Response Format
## Review Summary
[Assessment]

## Critical Issues
[Must fix]

## Suggestions
[Nice to have]
```

### Level 4: Plugins & MCP Servers

Extend capabilities with custom tools:

```typescript
// Custom MCP server for your database
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js";

const server = new Server({
  name: "my-database",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

server.setRequestHandler("tools/list", async () => ({
  tools: [{
    name: "query_customers",
    description: "Query customer data",
    inputSchema: { /* ... */ }
  }]
}));
```

### Level 5: Orchestration

Coordinate multiple agents for complex tasks:

```yaml
# Feature development workflow
steps:
  - agent: architect
    task: "Design feature architecture"

  - agent: coder
    task: "Implement based on design"

  - agent: reviewer
    task: "Review implementation"

  - agent: tester
    task: "Write comprehensive tests"
```

## MCP: The Model Context Protocol

MCP is the open standard that allows AI models to connect to your data and tools securely.

### Why MCP Matters

Before MCP, every integration was custom. Now:

- **Standardized**: Write once, use everywhere
- **Secure**: Authentication built into protocol
- **Growing**: Hundreds of community servers

### Core Components

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Resources** | Expose data to models | Database schemas |
| **Tools** | Let models take actions | Send email, query API |
| **Prompts** | Reusable templates | Code review prompt |

### Popular MCP Servers

- **PostgreSQL Server**: Query databases naturally
- **GitHub Server**: Manage repos and PRs
- **Slack Server**: Send messages and manage channels
- **Notion Server**: Access your workspace

## Enterprise Considerations

### When to Use Public APIs vs Private Infrastructure

| Use Case | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Experimentation | Public APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) |
| Production with sensitive data | Private deployment (Oracle GenAI, Azure OpenAI) |
| Regulatory compliance | Dedicated AI clusters |
| Custom fine-tuning needed | Self-hosted (Llama) or dedicated clusters |

### Oracle GenAI for Enterprise

For enterprises requiring:
- Data sovereignty
- Regulatory compliance (HIPAA, SOC2)
- Consistent performance guarantees
- Integration with existing OCI infrastructure

Oracle GenAI Services and Dedicated AI Clusters provide the control enterprises need.

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Small, Evolve Gradually

Don't try to implement everything at once. Master each level before moving to the next.

### 2. Invest in Project Context

A well-crafted CLAUDE.md saves hours of repeated explanations.

### 3. Build Skills Over Time

When you explain something twice, make it a skill.

### 4. Review AI Output

AI agents are powerful but not infallible. Always review generated code.

### 5. Use the Right Model for the Task

| Task | Recommended Model |
|------|------------------|
| Quick questions | Claude Haiku |
| General coding | Claude Sonnet |
| Complex architecture | Claude Opus |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between Claude Code and Copilot?

Claude Code is an autonomous agent that can execute multi-step tasks, read/write files, and run commands. Copilot is primarily code completion in your editor. They complement each other.

### Is my code safe with AI coding agents?

Reputable agents like Claude Code have strict security measures. Your code is processed but not stored or used for training. For maximum control, consider OpenCode with local models.

### How much do AI coding agents cost?

Claude Code uses Anthropic's API pricing (approximately $3/million tokens for Sonnet). For heavy use, costs can add up. OpenCode with local models eliminates API costs.

### Can I use multiple agents together?

Yes! Many developers use Claude Code for complex tasks and Copilot for inline completion. The evolution framework supports multi-agent orchestration.

### What about offline use?

OpenCode with local models (Llama, CodeLlama) works completely offline. Claude Code requires internet for API calls.
