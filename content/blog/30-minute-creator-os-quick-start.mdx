# The 30-Minute Creator OS: Build Your Minimum Viable Creative System

*Everything you need. Nothing you don't. Let's build.*

## Why 30 Minutes?

Most creator productivity content gives you elaborate systems that take weeks to set up. By the time you've configured everything, you've lost your creative momentum.

This is the opposite approach.

**In the next 30 minutes, you'll have:**
1. A capture system that never loses an idea
2. A create workflow that gets you to shipping
3. A ship ritual that actually publishes your work

That's it. No fancy dashboards. No 47-step automations. Just the three things that actually matter.

## Minute 0-5: The Capture System

**The Problem:** Ideas die in the gap between having them and recording them.

**The Solution:** One inbox. Everything goes there. Sort later.

### Setup (2 minutes)

Pick ONE of these:
- **Apple Notes** (iPhone) — Already on your phone, syncs everywhere
- **Notion Quick Capture** (Any device) — One button, one inbox
- **Voice Memos** (For shower thoughts) — Talk, transcribe later

That's your capture tool. Not five apps. One.

### The Rule (3 minutes to memorize)

```
Every idea gets ONE sentence in the inbox.
Within 24 hours.
No exceptions.
```

**Examples:**
- "Article about why AI tools feel soulless"
- "Melody with descending chords for focus track"
- "Product idea: prompt templates for coaches"

Don't elaborate. Don't organize. Just capture.

**Done:** You now have a capture system. Total time: 5 minutes.

---

## Minute 5-15: The Create Workflow

**The Problem:** You sit down to create and don't know where to start.

**The Solution:** A simple protocol that gets you from blank to draft in one session.

### The 3-Block Create Session

Every creation session has three blocks. Set a timer for each.

```
Block 1: PRIME (5 min)
- Open your inbox
- Pick ONE captured idea
- Write three bullet points about what this piece needs to say

Block 2: DRAFT (20-40 min)
- Write/create without stopping
- No editing, no perfecting
- Ugly first drafts are the goal

Block 3: CLOSE (5 min)
- Mark the draft "ready for edit" or "needs more work"
- Note what you'll do next session
- Close all apps
```

### Your Create Template

Copy this into wherever you write:

```markdown
# [Title]

## Prime (5 min)
- Point 1:
- Point 2:
- Point 3:

## Draft
[Start writing here. Don't stop until the timer goes off.]

## Close Notes
- Status: Ready / Needs work
- Next action:
```

### AI Acceleration (Optional)

If you're using Claude or ChatGPT, add this to Block 2:

```
"I have a piece about [topic] with these three points:
1. [point 1]
2. [point 2]
3. [point 3]

Write a rough first draft. Be bold. I'll rewrite in my voice."
```

Then edit heavily. The AI gives you clay; you sculpt it.

**Done:** You now have a create workflow. Total time: 10 minutes.

---

## Minute 15-25: The Ship Ritual

**The Problem:** Work sits in "draft" forever because publishing feels like a separate mountain.

**The Solution:** A 10-minute ritual that takes finished drafts to published.

### The Ship Checklist

After any piece is "ready for edit":

```
EDIT (5 min)
[ ] Read aloud once (catch awkward phrases)
[ ] Cut 10% of the words (tighten everything)
[ ] Add ONE image if needed

PUBLISH (5 min)
[ ] Copy to publishing platform (your blog, Substack, etc.)
[ ] Write 1-sentence description
[ ] Hit publish

SHARE (Optional)
[ ] Post to 1 social platform
[ ] Done. Move on.
```

### The Key Mindset Shift

**Shipping ≠ Launching**

A ship is just making work available. No fanfare required. No launch sequence. Just publish and move to the next thing.

Most of your published work won't blow up. That's fine. The goal is volume. The winners emerge from a body of work, not from picking the "perfect" piece to launch.

**Done:** You now have a ship ritual. Total time: 10 minutes.

## Minute 25-30: Your First Run

Let's test the system right now.

### Quick Exercise (5 minutes)

1. **Capture:** Write one idea in your inbox (30 seconds)
   - What's something you've been meaning to create?

2. **Create:** Write three bullet points for that idea (2 minutes)
   - What are the three things it needs to say?

3. **Commit:** Schedule your first create session (30 seconds)
   - When this week will you do a 30-minute session?

4. **Ship target:** Pick a date to ship this piece (1 minute)
   - It doesn't have to be perfect. When will it be published?

**Done:** Your Minimum Viable Creator OS is operational.

## What You Have Now

```
CAPTURE
└── One inbox for all ideas

CREATE
└── 3-block session (Prime → Draft → Close)

SHIP
└── 10-minute ritual (Edit → Publish → Share)
```

This is enough to create consistently. Everything else is optimization.

## What Comes Next (When You're Ready)

Once you're using this basic system for 2-3 weeks, you might want:

**Level 2 Upgrades:**
- Weekly review ritual (30 min/week)
- AI editing workflows
- Distribution automation

**Level 3 Upgrades:**
- Multi-project management
- Agent orchestration
- Content calendar systems

**But not yet.** First, prove you can ship with the basics. The fancy systems don't help if you're not creating.
