# 5 Agentic Workflows That Save Creators 10+ Hours Per Week

*The exact workflows running my content, consulting, and development.*

---

## TL;DR

Five workflows I run daily: (1) `/publish` — takes a title, produces blog post + hero image + social content in 30 minutes instead of 4 hours; (2) `/weekly-ops` — automated ops report pulling traffic, content, revenue data; (3) `/onboard` — client folder structure, welcome email, invoice template; (4) `/repurpose` — one blog post becomes LinkedIn, Twitter, video script, newsletter; (5) `/review` — code analysis, documentation, PR description. Combined savings: ~16 hours per week.

---

Repetitive work compounds against you. Blog posts, client updates, social content, reports—individually 30-60 minutes. Together, 10-15 hours lost weekly.

The [Agentic Creator OS](https://github.com/frankxai/agentic-creator-os) runs these as automated workflows. Copy the patterns below into your setup.

---

## Workflow 1: Blog Publishing Pipeline

**Manual time**: 3-4 hours per post
**Automated time**: 30 minutes (review/edit)
**Weekly savings**: 4-6 hours (for 2 posts)

### The Workflow

```markdown
/publish "Blog Title Here"

Steps:
1. CONTENT: Research topic, write draft, add SEO
2. DESIGN: Generate hero image, format visuals
3. DEV: Create MDX file, deploy to production
4. MARKETING: Generate social posts, schedule distribution
```

### What Happens

**Step 1: Content Creation**
```
→ Research trending content on topic
→ Create outline based on your style
→ Write 1,500-2,000 word draft
→ Add FAQ section for SEO
→ Include internal links
```

**Step 2: Visual Assets**
```
→ Generate hero image matching brand
→ Create OG image for social sharing
→ Format any code blocks or diagrams
```

**Step 3: Deployment**
```
→ Create MDX file with frontmatter
→ Run build verification
→ Deploy to production
→ Verify live URL
```

**Step 4: Distribution**
```
→ Generate LinkedIn post
→ Create Twitter thread
→ Draft newsletter snippet
→ Schedule posts (if integrated)
```

### Implementation

Create `~/.claude/skills/publish.md`:

```markdown
# /publish

When I say "/publish [title]", execute this workflow:

## Phase 1: Content
- Research: Find 3-5 top articles on this topic
- Outline: Create H2/H3 structure matching my blog style
- Draft: Write 1,500+ words with code examples where relevant
- SEO: Add 5+ FAQ questions at the end

## Phase 2: Assets
- Hero: Generate image with topic visualization
- Meta: Create title (60 chars), description (155 chars)

## Phase 3: Deploy
- File: Create content/blog/[slug].mdx
- Build: Verify no errors
- Deploy: Push to production

## Phase 4: Social
- LinkedIn: 1,300 char post with hook
- Twitter: 5-7 tweet thread
- Output: Display all content for review

Wait for my approval before deploying.
```

Every creator I talk to wants the same thing:

"I want my own Jarvis."

Not another chat tool. Not another subscription.

A personal AI that:
→ Knows your projects
→ Remembers your preferences
→ Executes your workflows
→ Gets smarter over time

Here's how to build it (free): [link]
```

**Twitter Thread** (7 tweets):
```
1/ Every creator wants their own Jarvis.

Here's how to build one (for free):

🧵

2/ The problem with AI tools...
[continues for 7 tweets]
```

**Video Script Outline**:
```

Problem (10-45s): Generic AI doesn't know you
Solution (45-90s): The Agentic Creator OS
Demo (90-180s): Show the workflow
CTA (180-210s): Get it free on GitHub
```

**Newsletter Version** (300 words, casual tone)

4. SHIP: Create PR description
```

### What Happens

**Code Review**:
```markdown
## Review: Authentication Feature

[Code examples]
```

### Implementation

```markdown
# /review

When I say "/review feature:[name]":

1. Find recent changes related to [name]
2. Analyze for:
   - Security issues
   - Performance concerns
   - Code quality
   - Missing tests
   - Documentation gaps

3. Generate:

## How to Use These Workflows

### Step 1: Copy the Patterns

Create skill files for each workflow:
```
~/.claude/skills/
├── publish.md
├── weekly-ops.md
├── onboard.md
├── repurpose.md
└── review.md
```

### Step 2: Customize to Your Needs

- Adjust tone and formatting
- Add your specific tools and integrations
- Include your brand guidelines
- Set up required data sources

### Step 3: Test and Refine

- Run each workflow 2-3 times
- Note what works and what doesn't
- Iterate based on results
- Add error handling as needed

### Step 4: Stack and Automate

Once workflows are solid:
- Chain workflows together
- Set up triggers (if your setup supports it)
- Build daily/weekly rituals around them

## Start Small

Don't try to implement all 5 at once. Pick the ONE workflow that wastes the most of your time right now.

Set it up. Use it for a week. Refine it. Then add the next one.

Compound automation beats scattered optimization every time.

## FAQ

### Can I use these without the full Agentic Creator OS?
Yes. Each workflow is a standalone skill file. Create the markdown file in `~/.claude/skills/` and it works with vanilla Claude Code. The full system adds coordination between departments.

### How do I connect to my analytics/CRM/email?
MCP servers handle integrations. The Agentic Creator OS includes pre-built servers for common tools. Custom integrations require writing an MCP server or using the API directly in your workflow.

### What if a workflow fails partway through?
Each workflow asks for approval before destructive actions (deploying, sending emails). If something fails, you can re-run from that step. Add error handling in your skill file as you learn what can break.

### Are these workflows specific to creators?
The patterns apply broadly—developers, consultants, anyone with repetitive knowledge work. The examples use creator terminology but the underlying automation transfers.

### How long to set up all five workflows?
About 2-3 hours total. Start with one, run it for a week, then add the next. Compound automation works better than scattered optimization.
