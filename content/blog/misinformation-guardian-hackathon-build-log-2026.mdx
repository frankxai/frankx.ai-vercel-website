# Misinformation Guardian Hackathon Build Log (February 12, 2026)

**TL;DR:** On **Wednesday, February 12, 2026**, we rapidly prototyped misinformation-defense capabilities in a hackathon sprint: started with a Custom GPT, hit limits on video analysis, switched to a Gemini Gem, tuned prompts for ~90 minutes, and shipped a visual demo direction that now maps to a production blueprint.

## Why We Built This

Misinformation moves faster than manual fact-check workflows. We wanted a system that helps people:

1. Detect manipulation patterns quickly.
2. Understand *why* content is risky.
3. Learn media literacy while deciding what to trust.

This started as a hackathon sprint, but the architecture has clear production potential.

## The 90-Minute Sprint Timeline

### 1) Starting Point: Custom GPT (Educational Win, Video Limit)

We first tested a Custom GPT:

- Link: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-698dca94190c819185e40361cfafaea5-misinformation-guardian
- What worked: strong educational framing, structured prompts, user-friendly guidance.
- What did not work well enough: **video-first analysis fidelity** for the demo goal.

### 2) Pivot: Gemini Gem for Live Demonstration

Next we moved to the Gemini Gem:

- Link: https://gemini.google.com/gem/16KpnhDSxs24YVTbOoauR9YehAvf3SPfo?usp=sharing
- Focus: faster prompt iteration and better multimodal framing for demo flow.
- Result: after roughly **90 minutes of testing and prompt tuning**, we had a stronger live showcase.

### 3) Visual Layer: Nano Banana Mockups

To communicate the capability, we used Nano Banana image generation to visualize outputs and analyst UI patterns.

## What We Learned Fast

### What worked

- Structured verdict format (claim, evidence, risk, recommendation).
- Visual-first storytelling for trust and comprehension.
- Prompt iteration loops with explicit rubric categories.

### What broke

- Single-agent prompting is not enough for high-confidence verification.
- Video claims require deeper multimodal and forensic layers than a simple prompt can provide.
- Without source/citation grounding, confidence can look higher than it should.

## From Demo to Product: The Architecture Shift

The hackathon output is now translated into a production path inside FrankX:

- Public hub: `/see-through-the-noise`
- Live analysis API: `/api/misinformation/analyze`
- Interactive blueprint: `/blueprint/misinformation-guardian-platform`
- Production spec: `docs/specs/SEE_THROUGH_THE_NOISE_BLUEPRINT.md`

Core production layers:

1. Ingest + normalize (text/URL/video metadata inputs)
2. Signal engine (manipulation markers + source checks + claim extraction)
3. Risk fusion + explainability
4. Policy routing + human escalation for high-impact domains
5. Audit ledger + evaluation loops

---

## Naming Strategy: See Through The Noise vs RealityDiffusion.ai

This is the recommendation after distilling the sprint:

- **RealityDiffusion.ai** = platform brand (the long-term product company)
- **See Through The Noise** = flagship experience/campaign (the user-facing trust product)

That split gives you both:

- a memorable mission phrase for audience adoption
- a scalable platform identity for future modules beyond misinformation

---

## What Comes Next

1. Add true multimodal video pipeline (frame/audio/metadata consistency checks).
2. Add retrieval-backed citation verification from trusted sources.
3. Add human review queue and appeal flow for high-stakes classifications.
4. Calibrate risk scoring on real eval sets (false positive/false negative tracking).

## FAQ

### Was this built in one day?
The **hackathon prototype direction** was built and demonstrated on **February 12, 2026**, with about 90 minutes of focused prompt iteration for the core demo flow.

### Why not stay only with the Custom GPT?
It was useful for education and framing, but the demo needed stronger handling for multimodal/video-oriented scenarios.

### Is this already production-ready?
The production foundation is in progress: live API, architecture blueprint, and deployment spec are now in place. Full trust-and-safety operations still require multimodal expansion, eval calibration, and human-review workflows.
