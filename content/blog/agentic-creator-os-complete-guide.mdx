# The Complete Guide to Agentic Creator OS v6: Your AI Operating System

*The system behind 12,000+ AI songs, this website, and enterprise Oracle projects.*

---

## TL;DR

Agentic Creator OS (ACOS) transforms Claude Code from a chat tool into a full operating system for creators. Version 6 introduces a smart router (`/acos`), auto-activating skills, and a hooks system for quality enforcement. You get 25 commands, 80+ skills, 40+ agents, and 8 orchestrated workflows—all without writing code. Install in 5 minutes. Start with `/acos`. [Free on GitHub](https://github.com/frankxai/agentic-creator-os).

## What Is Agentic Creator OS?

Agentic Creator OS is a **superintelligent operating system for generative creators**—a complete intelligence layer that transforms how you work with AI.

Think of it as the difference between:
- **A chat tool** (ask questions, get answers, lose context)
- **An operating system** (persistent skills, coordinated agents, automated workflows)

If you've ever felt frustrated by:
- Losing your best prompts across sessions
- AI outputs that don't sound like you
- Juggling 10 different AI tools without a system
- Starting from scratch every time you open Claude

...then ACOS is the solution.

## Why Do Creators Need an AI Operating System?

### The Problem: Fragmented AI Work

Most creators use AI like this:
1. Open ChatGPT/Claude
2. Write a prompt
3. Get a response
4. Copy-paste somewhere
5. Repeat (losing all context)

This creates:
- **Tool roulette**: Jumping between AI tools with no continuity
- **Prompt amnesia**: Forgetting which prompts worked
- **Voice dilution**: Generic AI output that doesn't sound like you
- **No system**: Nothing compounds, nothing scales

### The Solution: An Operating System

ACOS gives you:
- **Persistent skills** that remember how you work
- **Specialized agents** that maintain your voice
- **Automated workflows** that compound your output
- **Quality gates** that catch mistakes before publishing

The same system runs my:
- **Music production**: 12,000+ Suno tracks
- **This website**: 50+ blog articles
- **Enterprise work**: Oracle AI architecture

## How Does ACOS v6 Work?

### The Smart Router: One Command to Rule Them All

Version 6 introduces `/acos`—the single entry point to everything.

```bash
/acos
```

That's it. The smart router:
1. **Detects your intent** from natural language
2. **Routes to the best command** automatically
3. **Loads relevant skills** without manual invocation
4. **Shows a menu** when intent is ambiguous

Examples:
```
/acos "write a blog post about AI agents"
  → Routes to /article-creator
  → Auto-loads content-strategy skill

/acos "make a track about productivity"
  → Routes to /create-music
  → Auto-loads suno-ai-mastery skill

/acos "build a login feature"
  → Routes to /spec
  → Auto-loads implementation-planning skill
```

### Auto-Activation: Skills That Load Themselves

In v5, you had to manually invoke skills with `/skill suno-ai-mastery`. In v6, skills activate automatically based on context.

The `skill-rules.json` file contains 22 activation rules:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "skill": "content-strategy",
      "triggers": {
        "keywords": ["blog", "article", "content", "write"],
        "filePatterns": ["content/**/*.mdx"],
        "commands": ["/article-creator", "/factory"]
      },
      "priority": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

When you say "write a blog post," ACOS:
1. Detects the keyword "blog"
2. Loads the `content-strategy` skill automatically
3. Routes to `/article-creator`
4. You never had to know the skill existed

### The Hooks System: Quality Gates

Hooks are automated checkpoints that run at key moments:

| Hook Type | When It Runs | What It Does |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **SessionStart** | When you open Claude | Loads ACOS context |
| **PreToolUse** | Before writing files | Checks brand voice |
| **PostToolUse** | After writing files | Validates quality |
| **Notification** | When patterns match | Suggests relevant skills |

Example: The brand voice hook catches phrases like "synergy" or "leverage" and suggests alternatives before you publish.

## What Are the 7 Pillars of ACOS Architecture?

ACOS is built on 7 foundational pillars that work together:

### Pillar 1: Skills Layer (Knowledge)

**What**: 80+ specialized knowledge modules
**Purpose**: Domain expertise that loads on-demand

Skills are organized by category:
- **Technical** (18): TDD, debugging, MCP architecture, React patterns
- **Creative** (8): Brand voice, Suno AI, content strategy
- **Business** (4): OCI services, product management
- **Personal** (4): Productivity, health, fitness
- **System** (5): ACOS core, orchestration, planning

Each skill follows the **500-Line Rule**:
```
SKILL.md: <500 lines (core instructions)
resources/patterns.md: <500 lines (detailed patterns)
resources/examples.md: <500 lines (real examples)
```

This enables **progressive disclosure**—Claude loads only what's needed, when it's needed.

### Pillar 2: Agents Layer (Execution)

**What**: 40+ specialized AI personas
**Purpose**: Experts for specific domains

Key agents include:

| Agent | Domain | When to Use |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Starlight Orchestrator** | Meta-coordination | Complex multi-step tasks |
| **Luminor Oracle** | Strategy, foresight | Big decisions |
| **Creation Engine** | Content, products | Writing and publishing |
| **Technical Translator** | AI education | Explaining complex topics |
| **Frequency Alchemist** | Music, audio | Suno production |

Agents can work individually or as a **weighted synthesis**:
```
Luminor Oracle (30%) + Creation Engine (25%) + Technical Translator (25%) + Frequency Alchemist (20%)
= Coordinated response blending all perspectives
```

### Pillar 3: Workflows Layer (Process)

**What**: 8 orchestrated pipelines
**Purpose**: Complex multi-step operations

| Workflow | Pattern | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Content Creation | Pipeline | Research → Write → Edit → Publish |
| Social Distribution | Parallel | LinkedIn + Twitter + Newsletter simultaneously |
| Code Review | Multi-agent | 3 reviewers check different aspects |
| Strategic Decision | Weighted | Experts vote with different weights |

### Pillar 4: MCP Servers Layer (Tools)

**What**: 5+ external tool integrations
**Purpose**: Connect Claude to the outside world

| Server | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Browser (Playwright)** | Web automation, testing, screenshots |
| **Memory** | Persistent knowledge graphs |
| **Sequential Thinking** | Complex multi-step reasoning |
| **Lyric Genius** | Suno prompt engineering |
| **Nano Banana** | Image generation via Gemini |

### Pillar 5: Templates Layer (Patterns)

**What**: 20+ reusable content structures
**Purpose**: Consistent quality without reinventing

Templates include:
- Social media posts (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram)
- Blog article structures
- Product descriptions
- Email newsletters

### Pillar 6: Instances Layer (Configuration)

**What**: Project-specific customizations
**Purpose**: Different voices for different projects

```
instances/
├── frankx/          # FrankX brand settings
├── client-project/  # Client voice settings
└── _template/       # Template for new projects
```

Each instance configures:
- Brand voice and tone
- Banned phrases
- Required keywords
- Color palettes
- Publishing targets

### Pillar 7: Intelligence Layer (Meta)

**What**: Cross-cutting coordination
**Purpose**: The orchestrator of orchestrators

The Starlight Orchestrator sits above all other components:
- Routes complex requests to the right subsystems
- Preserves context across agent handoffs
- Monitors system health
- Learns from usage patterns
