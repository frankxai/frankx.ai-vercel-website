# Enterprise Agentic Architecture: Decision Framework for Production

**TL;DR**: The question isn't "how do I build agentic AI?" It's "should I, and at what maturity level?" This framework helps you decide if you're building a solo acoustic act or a full symphony orchestra—and how to architect for the performance you actually need.

## The Studio Session: From Demo to Production

The studio monitors are humming. It's 2 AM, and your prototype just nailed the perfect run. It reasoned, it executed, it delivered. You feel that rush—the same one I get when a track finally comes together after hours of mixing.

But here's the cold reality check: **A great demo is like a great solo in the shower. It's not ready for the stadium tour.**

Every enterprise leader I talk to shares the same struggle:
> "We built a demo in two weeks. Six months later, we're still debating how to deploy it."

The problem isn't the code. It's the composition. You're trying to score a film before you've written the main theme. This guide isn't about the syntax of agents; it's about the **rhythm of production**. It teaches you when to let the agents improvise, when to force them to follow the sheet music, and how to build a stage that doesn't collapse under the weight of the performance.

## The Producer's Board: A Decision Framework

Before we lay down a single track of code, we need to look at the mixing board. Adjust your levels based on these four faders:

Your answers here define your lineup. Don't hire a symphony when you just need a DJ.

## The Four-Tier Maturity Model (From Solo to Symphony)

Most teams over-engineer because they try to go straight to the symphony without learning to play the instrument first. Let's look at the progression.

![Maturity Model](/images/blog/production-agentic-ai-systems-maturity-model.svg)

**Critical insight**: Most of you should be rocking Tier 1 or 2. Tier 3 and 4 are for when you've sold out the stadium.

## Reference Architecture: The Six-Plane Stage

Whether you're playing a dive bar or Wembley, you need a stage, instruments, and sound. In agentic systems, we call this the Six-Plane Model.

## Architectural Decisions (The Rider)

Every tour has a rider—the non-negotiables. Here are the Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) you need for each level of fame.

### Tier 1 → Tier 2: Going Autonomous
| Decision | Context | Choice | Trade-off |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Orchestration** | Tracking the song structure | Graph-based state machine | +Explicit rhythm / -Takes time to compose |
| **State Management** | Keeping everyone in tune | Typed state contracts (Pydantic) | +No bad notes / -More prep work |
| **Error Handling** | The show must go on | Retry limits + exponential backoff | +Resilience / -Can slow the tempo |
| **Quality Gates** | Catching bad takes | Multi-stage validation | +Quality / -Latency |

### Tier 2 → Tier 3: The Ensemble
| Decision | Context | Choice | Trade-off |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Agent Selection** | Who plays the solo? | Model routing layer | +Best sound per instrument / -Complex wiring |
| **Handoff Protocol** | Passing the melody | Structured handoff schema | +Clarity / -Overhead |
| **Failure Isolation** | Broken string? | Circuit breaker per agent | +Band keeps playing / -One part missing |
| **Human Checkpoints** | The Producer's final listen | Async approval queue | +Safety / -Wait time |

### Tier 3 → Tier 4: The Label Platform
| Decision | Context | Choice | Trade-off |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Multi-Tenancy** | Multiple bands, one studio | Namespace isolation | +Efficiency / -Noisy neighbors |
| **Self-Service** | DIY recording | Declarative workflow specs | +Speed / -Governance |
| **Cost Allocation** | Who pays for the studio time? | Per-workflow token tracking | +Accountability / -Instrumentation cost |

## The Cost-Complexity Curve

Don't buy a stadium sound system for a coffee shop gig. This is where budgets die.

## When NOT to Use Agentic AI

Sometimes, you don't need AI. You just need a spreadsheet.

| Your Situation | Agentic AI? | Better Alternative |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Workflow has < 3 steps | **No** | Simple API calls |
| Predictable inputs & outputs | **No** | Traditional automation |
| No budget for rehearsals | **No** | Pre-built SaaS tools |
| Zero tolerance for wrong notes | **No** | Human-only workflow |
| Novel situations requiring improv | **Yes** | **This is the jam.** |

---

## Failure Mode Analysis (The Feedback Loop)

When the mic feeds back, it ruins the show. Here's how to stop the screeching before it starts.

| Failure Mode | The Symptom | The Fix |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Infinite Loop** | The agent gets stuck on a riff | MAX_RETRIES=3 + backoff |
| **State Corruption** | The band is playing different songs | Pydantic validation on every bar |
| **Silent Failure** | The solo ended but no one clapped | Multi-stage output validation |
| **Hallucination Cascade** | One wrong note ruins the chord | Cross-agent fact-checking |
| **Cost Explosion** | The studio bill is astronomical | Token budgets + auto-throttle |

---

## Implementation Roadmap (The Rehearsal Schedule)

Don't book the gig until you've practiced. Here's your schedule:

![Implementation Roadmap](/images/blog/production-agentic-ai-systems-roadmap.svg)

### Code Example: State Contract (Tier 2+)

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from enum import Enum
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional

class WorkflowState(str, Enum):
    """The song structure—everyone needs to know the key and time signature."""
    PENDING = "pending"
    RESEARCHING = "researching"
    DRAFTING = "drafting"
    REVIEWING = "reviewing"
    APPROVED = "approved"
    FAILED = "failed"

class ResearchResult(BaseModel):
    """Each section needs its own sheet music."""
    sources: list[str] = Field(..., min_items=1)
    summary: str = Field(..., min_length=50, max_length=500)
    confidence: float = Field(..., ge=0.0, le=1.0)

class AgentWorkflowState(BaseModel):
    """The state contract—validation on every transition."""
    workflow_id: str
    current_state: WorkflowState = WorkflowState.PENDING
    research_result: Optional[ResearchResult] = None
    draft_content: Optional[str] = None
    retry_count: int = 0
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
    token_budget_remaining: int = Field(default=10000)
    
    def transition_to(self, new_state: WorkflowState) -> None:
        """Explicit state transitions prevent silent corruption."""
        valid_transitions = {
            WorkflowState.PENDING: [WorkflowState.RESEARCHING],
            WorkflowState.RESEARCHING: [WorkflowState.DRAFTING, WorkflowState.FAILED],
            WorkflowState.DRAFTING: [WorkflowState.REVIEWING, WorkflowState.FAILED],
            WorkflowState.REVIEWING: [WorkflowState.APPROVED, WorkflowState.FAILED],
        }
        
        if new_state not in valid_transitions.get(self.current_state, []):
            raise ValueError(f"Cannot transition from {self.current_state} to {new_state}")
        
        self.current_state = new_state
```

This is your **state contract**—it keeps everyone in tune. Pydantic validates on every bar change, and explicit transitions prevent the "wrong song" problem.

## Framework Comparison

| Framework | Best For | The Vibe | Tier Match |
|-----------|----------|----------|------------|
| **Claude SDK** | Native apps, prototyping | **Indie Rock** | Tier 1-2 |
| **LangGraph** | Complex state machines | **Prog Rock** | Tier 2-3 |
| **CrewAI** | Role-based collaboration | **Jazz Improv** | Tier 2-3 |
| **OCI Agent Platform** | Enterprise governance | **Symphony Hall** | Tier 3-4 |

**Frank's Take**: Start with the Claude SDK or LangGraph. Don't rent the Symphony Hall until you can fill the seats.

## FAQ: Studio Notes

**Q: Does this actually save money?**
Only if the work requires *improvisation*. If it's routine, use a script. If it requires judgment (handling the 20% of exceptions), then yes—agents are your affordable session musicians.

**Q: How do I stop hallucinations?**
Three layers of soundproofing: (1) Constrain the tools (don't give the drummer a trumpet). (2) Verify the output (listen to the playback). (3) Human approval for the hit singles (high stakes).

**Q: Minimum team size?**
Tier 1: You on a laptop. Tier 2: You and a dedicated engineer. Tier 3: A small band (3-5 devs). Tier 4: A full production crew (10+).

**Q: Same model for everyone?**
No. You don't use a Stradivarius to hammer a nail. Use cheaper models for simple tasks (classification) and the heavy hitters (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o) for the complex solos.

**Q: How do I test this?**
Unit tests for the notes. Integration tests for the melody. Golden set evaluations for the soul. Never test against live LLMs in your CI pipeline—that's like rehearsing during the show.

## Your Next Step

1.  **Check your tier**: Are you a soloist or a conductor?
2.  **Set the stage**: Answer the decision framework.
3.  **Start simple**: You can always add instruments later. Removing them is harder.
