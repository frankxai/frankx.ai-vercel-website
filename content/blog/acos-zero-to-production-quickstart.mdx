# ACOS Quick Start: Zero to Production in 10 Minutes

*From clone to creating in one coffee break.*

---

## TL;DR

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frankxai/agentic-creator-os.git
cd agentic-creator-os
./install.sh
claude
/acos
```

That's it. You now have 25 commands, 80+ skills, and 40+ agents. This guide walks through each step with explanations.

---

## Prerequisites (2 minutes)

Before starting, you need:

| Requirement | How to Check | Install Link |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Node.js 18+** | `node --version` | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| **Claude Code CLI** | `claude --version` | [claude.ai/claude-code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) |
| **Git** | `git --version` | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) |

**Quick Check:**
```bash
node --version    # Should show v18.x or higher
claude --version  # Should show claude-code version
git --version     # Should show git version
```

All good? Let's go.

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository (30 seconds)

```bash
# Clone ACOS
git clone https://github.com/frankxai/agentic-creator-os.git

# Enter the directory
cd agentic-creator-os

# Verify you're in the right place
ls
```

You should see:
```
README.md
CLAUDE.md
install.sh
.claude/
skills/
templates/
workflows/
departments/
mcp-servers/
```

---

## Step 2: Run the Installer (1 minute)

```bash
# Make installer executable
chmod +x install.sh

# Run it
./install.sh
```

**What the installer does:**
1. Copies commands to `~/.claude/commands/`
2. Copies skills to `~/.claude/skills/`
3. Sets up configuration files
4. Validates your environment

You'll see output like:
```
[ACOS] Installing Agentic Creator OS v6.0...
[ACOS] Copying 25 commands...
[ACOS] Copying 80+ skills...
[ACOS] Setting up skill-rules.json...
[ACOS] Installation complete!
[ACOS] Run 'claude' then '/acos' to start.
```

---

## Step 3: Launch Claude Code (30 seconds)

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude
```

You're now in the Claude Code CLI. The ACOS context is automatically loaded because you're in the `agentic-creator-os` directory.

---

## Step 4: Run Your First Command (1 minute)

```bash
/acos
```

You'll see the ACOS system status:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                    AGENTIC CREATOR OS v6.0                         ║
║          "The Operating System for Golden Age Creators"            ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  Commands: 25 │ Skills: 80+ │ Agents: 40+ │ Workflows: 8          ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Available Commands:
- /article-creator    Write a blog post
- /create-music       Produce a track
- /spec               Build a feature
- /infogenius         Generate images
- /starlight-architect Design AI systems
...
```

---

## Step 5: Create Something (5 minutes)

Let's write a blog post to test the system:

```bash
/article-creator
```

ACOS will ask:
- **Topic**: What do you want to write about?
- **Audience**: Who's reading this?
- **Goal**: What should readers learn/do?

**Example Session:**
```
You: /article-creator

ACOS: What topic would you like to write about?

You: How to use AI for personal productivity

ACOS: [Loads content-strategy skill automatically]
      [Creates outline]
      [Drafts article with SEO optimization]
      [Offers to generate hero image]

# 5 minutes later: Complete, publish-ready article
```

## Customizing Your Setup

### Change Your Brand Voice

Edit `instances/frankx/config.json` or create your own:

```json
{
  "brand": {
    "name": "Your Brand",
    "voice": "professional, friendly, direct",
    "bannedPhrases": ["synergy", "leverage", "circle back"],
    "preferredPhrases": ["build", "create", "ship"]
  }
}
```

### Add Custom Skills

Create a skill file in `~/.claude/skills/`:

```markdown
---
name: my-custom-skill
triggers:
  - keyword1
  - keyword2
---

# My Custom Skill

## When to Use
[Describe when this skill should activate]

## Patterns
[Your domain knowledge here]
```

### Enable MCP Servers

Check which MCP servers are available:

```bash
/mcp-status
```

Configure in Claude Code settings for:
- Browser automation (Playwright)
- Image generation (Nano Banana)
- Music prompts (Lyric Genius)
- Memory persistence

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found"

```bash
# Reinstall commands
cp agentic-creator-os/.claude/commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

### Skills not auto-loading

```bash
# Check skill-rules.json exists
cat ~/.claude/skill-rules.json

# If missing, copy from repo
cp agentic-creator-os/.claude/skill-rules.json ~/.claude/
```

### Claude Code not recognizing ACOS

Make sure you're in a directory with a `CLAUDE.md` file, or the `agentic-creator-os` directory itself.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Yes. ACOS commands and skills are additive. They won't interfere with your existing setup.

### Is ACOS free?

Completely free and open source. No subscriptions, no paywalls, no limits.
