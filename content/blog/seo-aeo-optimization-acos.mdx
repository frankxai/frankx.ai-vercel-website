# SEO & AEO Optimization with ACOS: Rank in Search and AI Engines

*How to write content that Google AND ChatGPT want to cite.*

---

## TL;DR

Traditional SEO optimizes for Google. AEO (AI Engine Optimization) optimizes for ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude. ACOS does both through: question-based H2 headings, FAQ schema markup, TL;DR in first 100 words, numbered lists for AI extraction, and the `/factory` pipeline that enforces these patterns automatically. This guide covers the framework and shows how to implement it.

---

## What Is AEO (AI Engine Optimization)?

AEO is the practice of optimizing content for AI assistants to cite. When someone asks ChatGPT "What is the best AI productivity system?", you want your content cited as the answer.

**SEO vs AEO:**

| Dimension | SEO (Search) | AEO (AI Engines) |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Target** | Google, Bing | ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude |
| **Success** | Rank #1 | Get cited/quoted |
| **Format** | Keywords, backlinks | Clear statements, lists |
| **Intent** | User clicks through | AI extracts and summarizes |
| **Metrics** | Rankings, traffic | Citations, brand mentions |

### Why AEO Matters in 2026

The numbers tell the story:

- **40%** of search queries now touch AI systems
- **ChatGPT** has 200M+ weekly users asking questions
- **Perplexity** growing 30% month-over-month
- **AI Overviews** appearing in 25%+ of Google searches

If your content isn't optimized for AI extraction, you're invisible to a growing segment of information seekers.

## The ACOS Content Framework

ACOS enforces SEO/AEO best practices through the content pipeline. Here's the framework:

### 1. Question-Based H2 Headings

**Why:** AI engines look for questions to match user queries. Google loves them for featured snippets.

```markdown
# Bad H2s
## Introduction
## Features
## Conclusion

# Good H2s (Question-Based)
## What Is Agentic Creator OS?
## How Does the Smart Router Work?
## Why Do Creators Need an AI Operating System?
```

**ACOS Implementation:**
The `/article-creator` command automatically structures articles with question-based headings:

```bash
/article-creator "Guide to AI productivity"

# ACOS generates:
## What Is AI Productivity?
## Why Do Traditional Tools Fall Short?
## How Does AI-Powered Productivity Work?
## What Are the Best AI Productivity Tools?
## How Do I Get Started?
```

### 2. TL;DR in First 100 Words

**Why:** AI engines often extract the first paragraph. Make it count.

```markdown
# Bad Opening
In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the many facets of AI productivity...

# Good Opening (TL;DR)
AI productivity systems automate repetitive work, coordinate multiple tools, and
maintain context across sessions. The best approach: use an operating system like
ACOS that combines 25 commands, 80+ skills, and 40+ agents. Start with `/acos`.
```

**ACOS Implementation:**
Every article template includes a TL;DR section that's populated first.

### 3. FAQ Schema Markup

**Why:** FAQ schema gets featured snippets and AI citations.

```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "ACOS (Agentic Creator OS) is an open-source operating system..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Numbered Lists for AI Extraction

**Why:** AI engines love extracting numbered lists. They're easy to parse and cite.

```markdown
# Bad
There are several benefits including speed, quality, and consistency...

# Good
The 5 key benefits of ACOS:
1. **Speed**: 10x faster content creation
2. **Quality**: Built-in quality gates
3. **Consistency**: Brand voice enforcement
4. **Scale**: Handle more projects
5. **Learning**: Skills compound over time
```

### 5. Clear Definitions

**Why:** AI engines cite definitions verbatim.

```markdown
# Bad
Multi-agent orchestration is kind of like having multiple AI helpers...

# Good
**Multi-agent orchestration** is the coordination of multiple specialized AI
agents to complete complex tasks. Each agent handles a specific domain while
an orchestrator manages handoffs and synthesizes outputs.
```

### 6. Internal Linking Strategy

**Why:** Both Google and AI engines follow links to understand content relationships.

```markdown
## Hub and Spoke Model

Hub Article: [Complete Guide to ACOS](/blog/agentic-creator-os-complete-guide)
  ├── [Swarm Intelligence](/blog/swarm-intelligence-multi-agent-orchestration)
  ├── [Use Cases by Creator Type](/blog/acos-use-cases-creator-types)
  ├── [MCP Server Integration](/blog/mcp-server-integration-guide)
  ├── [Building Custom Skills](/blog/building-custom-skills-acos)
  └── [Quick Start Guide](/blog/acos-zero-to-production-quickstart)
```

**ACOS Implementation:**
The `/article-creator` automatically suggests relevant internal links from your content inventory.

---

## The /factory Pipeline

The `/factory` command enforces all SEO/AEO best practices automatically:

```bash
/factory "Complete guide to AI agents for enterprise"

# Pipeline:
1. RESEARCH → Gather current data, competitor analysis
2. PLAN → Structure with question-based H2s
3. DRAFT → Write with TL;DR, lists, definitions
4. OPTIMIZE → Add FAQ section, internal links
5. VALIDATE → Check SEO/AEO checklist
6. PUBLISH → Deploy with schema markup
```
