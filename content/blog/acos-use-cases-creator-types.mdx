# ACOS Use Cases: Find Your Creator Type and Ideal Workflow

_Not everyone creates the same way. Here's how to configure ACOS for your archetype._

---

## TL;DR

ACOS serves 6 creator archetypes: **Writers** (content → publication pipeline), **Developers** (spec → ship workflow), **Musicians** (idea → track → distribution), **Entrepreneurs** (strategy → execution), **Course Creators** (knowledge → product), and **Agency Owners** (client → delivery). Each archetype has different primary commands, skills, and workflows. Find yours below and start with the recommended setup.

---

## Find Your Creator Archetype

Before diving into ACOS, identify which archetype best describes your work:

| Archetype              | Primary Output                | Pain Points                              | ACOS Solution                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **The Writer**         | Articles, books, scripts      | Blank page syndrome, editing loops       | Content pipeline automation   |
| **The Developer**      | Code, apps, features          | Context switching, spec drift            | Spec-driven development       |
| **The Musician**       | Tracks, albums, scores        | Prompt iteration, distribution           | Suno integration + publishing |
| **The Entrepreneur**   | Strategy, decisions, launches | Information overload, analysis paralysis | Multi-agent council           |
| **The Course Creator** | Courses, workshops, ebooks    | Content organization, production         | Knowledge → product pipeline  |
| **The Agency Owner**   | Client deliverables           | Scaling, consistency, handoffs           | Department automation         |

Most creators are **hybrids**—combining 2-3 archetypes. That's fine. Start with your primary and expand.

## The Writer: Content → Publication Pipeline

### Who You Are

You write blog posts, newsletters, books, scripts, or documentation. Your challenge is moving from idea to published piece without getting stuck in endless revision cycles.

### Your Pain Points

- **Blank page syndrome**: Starting is the hardest part
- **Research rabbit holes**: Hours disappear gathering information
- **Editing loops**: Never feeling "done"
- **Distribution burden**: Writing is fun, promoting is not

### Your ACOS Setup

**Primary Commands:**

```bash
/article-creator    # Guided blog post creation
/factory            # Full pipeline: research → publish
/author-team        # Book writing with AI team
/polish-content     # Final refinement pass
```

**Recommended Skills:**

- `content-strategy` — Auto-activates on "blog", "article", "write"
- `excellence-book-writing` — For long-form projects
- `seo-optimization` — For search visibility

**Your Workflow:**

<Diagram
  src="/images/diagrams/blog/acos-use-cases-creator-types/legacy-diagram-01.svg"
  alt="Your ACOS Setup diagram 1"
  caption="Your ACOS Setup"
/>

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Your first writing session
/acos "write a blog post about [your topic]"

# ACOS will:
# 1. Load content-strategy skill
# 2. Route to /article-creator
# 3. Guide you through outline → draft → polish
# 4. Offer to publish when ready
```

### Writer Pro Tips

1. **Use `/plan-week`** every Monday to batch your content ideas
2. **Let research agent work first**—don't start writing until you have sources
3. **Trust the polish agent**—it catches things you miss after hours of staring

---

## The Developer: Spec → Ship Workflow

### Who You Are

You build software—features, apps, tools, integrations. Your challenge is translating requirements into working code without losing track of the original intent.

### Your Pain Points

- **Spec drift**: What you build doesn't match what was asked
- **Context switching**: Jumping between planning and coding
- **Testing gaps**: Forgetting edge cases
- **Documentation debt**: Code ships, docs don't

### Your ACOS Setup

**Primary Commands:**

```bash
/spec               # Spec-driven feature development
/automation-dev     # MCP servers and tooling
/nextjs-deploy      # Ship to production
/ux-design          # UI/UX workflows
```

**Recommended Skills:**

- `test-driven-development` — Auto-activates on "test", "spec", "feature"
- `implementation-planning` — For complex features
- `systematic-debugging` — When things break
- `mcp-architecture` — For building integrations

**Your Workflow:**

<Diagram
  src="/images/diagrams/blog/acos-use-cases-creator-types/legacy-diagram-02.svg"
  alt="Your ACOS Setup diagram 2"
  caption="Your ACOS Setup"
/>

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Your first feature build
/spec "Add user authentication with OAuth"

# ACOS will:
# 1. Create spec file with requirements
# 2. Break into implementation tasks
# 3. Guide through each task with context
# 4. Run tests and validate completion
```

### Developer Pro Tips

1. **Never skip the spec**—`/spec` creates the contract you code against
2. **Use Task agents** for exploration—don't read every file yourself
3. **Let `/automation-dev`** build your MCP servers—it knows the patterns

## The Musician: Idea → Track → Distribution

### Who You Are

You create music—songs, soundscapes, scores, beats. Your challenge is turning musical ideas into finished, distributed tracks without getting lost in infinite iteration.

### Your Pain Points

- **Prompt iteration**: Finding the right Suno prompt takes forever
- **Style consistency**: Keeping a coherent sound across tracks
- **Distribution complexity**: Getting music onto platforms
- **Metadata management**: Track info, artwork, descriptions

### Your ACOS Setup

**Primary Commands:**

```bash
/create-music       # Full Suno production pipeline
/generate-images    # Album art and visuals
/generate-social    # Platform-specific promotion
/inventory-status   # Track your music catalog
```

**Recommended Skills:**

- `suno-ai-mastery` — Auto-activates on "music", "track", "song", "Suno"
- `frankx-brand` — For consistent aesthetic (customize for your brand)

**MCP Servers:**

- `lyric-genius` — Advanced prompt engineering for Suno

**Your Workflow:**

<Diagram
  src="/images/diagrams/blog/acos-use-cases-creator-types/legacy-diagram-03.svg"
  alt="Your ACOS Setup diagram 3"
  caption="Your ACOS Setup"
/>

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Your first track
/create-music "Epic orchestral piece about overcoming adversity,
               Hans Zimmer inspired, building from quiet to triumphant"

# ACOS will:
# 1. Load suno-ai-mastery skill
# 2. Craft optimized Suno prompts
# 3. Generate track variations
# 4. Create album art
# 5. Prepare social media posts
```

### Musician Pro Tips

1. **Describe emotion, not just genre**—"melancholic determination" beats "sad rock"
2. **Use Lyric Genius MCP** for advanced prompt crafting
3. **Batch your sessions**—create 5 tracks, then distribute all at once

## The Entrepreneur: Strategy → Execution System

### Who You Are

You run a business—making decisions, launching products, managing growth. Your challenge is cutting through information overload to make good decisions fast.

### Your Pain Points

- **Analysis paralysis**: Too much information, no clear path
- **Execution gaps**: Great strategy, poor follow-through
- **Scaling yourself**: Can't be everywhere at once
- **Consistency**: Different decisions in similar situations

### Your ACOS Setup

**Primary Commands:**

```bash
/starlight-architect  # Enterprise AI system design
/council              # Multi-agent strategic decisions
/research             # Market and competitive intelligence
/plan-week            # Operational planning
```

**Recommended Skills:**

- `product-management` — Auto-activates on "launch", "product", "roadmap"
- `content-strategy` — For marketing execution
- `oci-services-expert` — If you're in enterprise/Oracle space

**Your Workflow:**

<Diagram
  src="/images/diagrams/blog/acos-use-cases-creator-types/legacy-diagram-04.svg"
  alt="Your ACOS Setup diagram 4"
  caption="Your ACOS Setup"
/>

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Your first strategic decision
/council "Should I launch a premium tier for my SaaS product?
          Current: 1000 users at $29/mo, 5% churn"

# ACOS will:
# 1. Convene Visionary (strategy), Creation Engine (product),
#    Technical Translator (feasibility)
# 2. Each agent analyzes from their perspective
# 3. Weighted synthesis produces recommendation
# 4. You get a decision report with confidence score
```

### Entrepreneur Pro Tips

1. **Use `/council` for big decisions**—it forces multiple perspectives
2. **`/research` before `/council`**—better inputs = better decisions
3. **Make `/plan-week` a Sunday ritual**—start each week with clarity

## The Course Creator: Knowledge → Product Pipeline

### Who You Are

You package expertise into courses, workshops, ebooks, and educational products. Your challenge is organizing knowledge into learnable sequences and actually shipping.

### Your Pain Points

- **Curriculum overwhelm**: Too much to teach, where to start?
- **Production bottleneck**: Recording, editing, publishing is slow
- **Consistency**: Maintaining quality across modules
- **Marketing**: Great course, no students

### Your ACOS Setup

**Primary Commands:**

```bash
/products-creation   # Digital product development
/article-creator     # Course companion content
/factory             # Full content pipeline
/generate-social     # Launch marketing
```

**Recommended Skills:**

- `excellence-book-writing` — Auto-activates for educational content
- `content-strategy` — For curriculum planning
- `coaching-program-design` — If you do 1:1 or cohort programs

**Your Workflow:**

<Diagram
  src="/images/diagrams/blog/acos-use-cases-creator-types/legacy-diagram-05.svg"
  alt="Your ACOS Setup diagram 5"
  caption="Your ACOS Setup"
/>

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Your first course module
/products-creation "Create Module 1 of a course on
                    'Building AI Workflows with Claude Code'
                    Target: developers new to AI agents
                    Format: 5 lessons, 10-15 min each"

# ACOS will:
# 1. Generate course outline with learning objectives
# 2. Draft lesson content with examples
# 3. Create companion exercises
# 4. Suggest assessment questions
```

### Course Creator Pro Tips

1. **Start with one module, not the whole course**—ship and iterate
2. **Use `/article-creator`** to create free content that leads to paid
3. **`/generate-social`** can create a full launch sequence

---

## The Agency Owner: Client → Delivery Automation

### Who You Are

You run an agency—delivering services to multiple clients with a team. Your challenge is maintaining quality and consistency while scaling.

### Your Pain Points

- **Scaling quality**: More clients = more variance
- **Onboarding overhead**: Every client is a fresh start
- **Team consistency**: Different people, different outputs
- **Process documentation**: Tribal knowledge in people's heads

### Your ACOS Setup

**Primary Commands:**

```bash
/starlight-architect  # System design for client projects
/spec                 # Scoped deliverables
/review-content       # Quality assurance
/planning-with-files  # Project tracking
```

**Recommended Skills:**

- `implementation-planning` — For project scoping
- `content-strategy` — If you do content/marketing services
- `mcp-architecture` — For technical integrations

**Your Workflow:**

<Diagram
  src="/images/diagrams/blog/acos-use-cases-creator-types/legacy-diagram-06.svg"
  alt="Your ACOS Setup diagram 6"
  caption="Your ACOS Setup"
/>

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Your first client project
/spec "Website redesign for [Client Name]
       Requirements: Modern design, 5 pages, contact form
       Timeline: 4 weeks
       Budget: $5000"

# ACOS will:
# 1. Create detailed project spec
# 2. Break into phases with milestones
# 3. Generate task list for team
# 4. Set up review checkpoints
```

### Agency Owner Pro Tips

1. **Create client instances**—each client gets their own brand config
2. **Use `/review-content`** as quality gate before client delivery
3. **Document everything in planning files**—reduces "how did we do X last time?"

**Commands:** `/factory` → `/generate-social` → `/plan-week`
**Flow:** Write → Distribute → Monetize

### Developer + Course Creator (Educator)

**Primary:** Technical education products
**Commands:** `/spec` → `/products-creation` → `/article-creator`
**Flow:** Build → Document → Teach

### Musician + Entrepreneur (Artist-Business)

**Primary:** Music as business
**Commands:** `/create-music` → `/generate-social` → `/inventory-status`
**Flow:** Create → Promote → Track

### Writer + Developer (Technical Writer)

**Primary:** Documentation and tutorials
**Commands:** `/article-creator` + `/spec` integration
**Flow:** Understand → Document → Publish

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know which archetype I am?

Look at what you spend most of your time creating. If it's written content, you're a Writer. If it's code, you're a Developer. Most people are hybrids—that's normal.

### Can I use commands from other archetypes?

Absolutely. All 25 commands work for everyone. The archetypes just help you prioritize which to learn first.

### How do I configure ACOS for my brand?

Create an instance in `instances/your-brand/config.json` with your voice settings, banned phrases, and color palette. All agents will respect these settings.

### What if my work doesn't fit any archetype?

Start with Entrepreneur—the strategy commands work for almost any creative/business work. Then add specific skills as needed.

### Can I create custom workflows for my hybrid?

Yes. Workflows are YAML files. You can chain any commands together. See [Building Custom Skills](/blog/building-custom-skills-acos).
