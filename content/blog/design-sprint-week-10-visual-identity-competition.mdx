# Design Sprint: Three AI Teams Compete to Define frankx.ai's Visual Identity

_What happens when you pit three design philosophies against each other with real code? You get three production-ready visual identity systems in one session._

**TL;DR:** Instead of iterating on one design direction, I created three competing "design god teams" — each proposing a complete visual identity with live hero components, card systems, typography, and color strategies. The Strategy Arena at [/design-lab/strategy](/design-lab/strategy) presents all three side by side. The winner gets implemented across the entire site.

## The Problem: 232 Pages, No Signature

frankx.ai has 232 pages, a mature component library, and a solid design token system. But it lacks a **signature visual identity** — the one thing that makes visitors instantly know "this is frankx.ai."

Look at the competition:

- **Linear** owns specular glass with monochrome restraint
- **Stripe** owns the animated mesh gradient hero
- **Vercel** owns Geist minimalism with performance-as-design
- **Raycast** owns product glow with warm palettes

FrankX needs to pick its move and execute it comprehensively.

## The Approach: Competition Over Iteration

Traditional design: pick a direction, iterate, second-guess, iterate more.

What I did instead: three competing teams, each with a complete proposal. No compromise. Each team goes all-in on their philosophy.

### Team Alpha: Cosmic Forge — Atmospheric Drama

**Signature move:** Animated mesh gradient rendered on GPU via GLSL fragment shaders.

The hero uses four brand color control points (`#AB47C7`, `#43BFE3`, `#10b981`, `#0a0a0b`) blended through sine-based noise functions running entirely on the GPU. The result: buttery-smooth organic gradients at fractional CPU cost.

```glsl
vec3 c0 = vec3(0.671, 0.278, 0.780); // Purple
vec3 c1 = vec3(0.263, 0.749, 0.890); // Cyan
vec3 c2 = vec3(0.063, 0.725, 0.506); // Emerald
vec3 c3 = vec3(0.039, 0.039, 0.043); // Void
```

Below the fold: absolute silence. Monochrome cards, no gradients, no floating elements. The contrast between the dramatic hero and the calm body creates tension that keeps you scrolling.

**Card system:** GlowCard with cursor-following radial glow. Already in the component library, 11 color presets.

**Philosophy:** "One spectacle, then silence."

### Team Beta: Glass Cathedral — Systematic Elegance

**Signature move:** Four-tier glassmorphism hierarchy where every element communicates its importance through blur, opacity, and border intensity.

| Level | Material | Blur | Usage                |
| ----- | -------- | ---- | -------------------- |
| 0     | none     | 0px  | Section containers   |
| 1     | frosted  | 24px | Standard cards       |
| 2     | crystal  | 40px | Feature cards, stats |
| 3     | liquid   | 60px | CTAs, premium forms  |

No animation. No gradient text. Everything fades in together (no stagger) over 800ms. The stillness IS the statement.

**Card system:** GlassCard with element theming — `water` for cyan tint, `fire` for warmth, `arcane` for purple. Glass tier maps to content importance.

**Philosophy:** "Glass does not jump. Glass catches light."

### Team Gamma: Neon Grid — Electric Precision

**Signature move:** Canvas-rendered dot grid with cursor-repulsion physics. 2px dots at 40px spacing — dots within 200px of your cursor shift away by up to 8px, creating a living background that responds to movement.

```typescript
if (dist < repelRadius && dist > 0) {
  const force = (1 - dist / repelRadius) * repelStrength;
  dx = (distX / dist) * force;
  dy = (distY / dist) * force;
}
```

Per-section color rotation through the brand palette: emerald for AI Architecture, amber for Creative Systems, violet for Open Tools. Each section owns its color.

**Card system:** NeonCard wrapping ShimmerCard with an expanding gradient accent line — 12px wide at rest, full width on hover.

**Philosophy:** "Everything earns its entrance."

## The Strategy Arena

All three approaches are live at [/design-lab/strategy](/design-lab/strategy) with:

- **Live hero previews** in browser-frame containers
- **Card system demos** showing each approach's core card component
- **Typography specimens** with heading/body/monospace samples
- **Color palette swatches** with hex values
- **Motion philosophy** descriptions
- **Pros and cons** for each approach
- **Side-by-side comparison matrix** across 10 dimensions

No mockups. No Figma screenshots. Real components rendering in the browser.

## What I Learned

**Competition produces clarity.** When you commit to three distinct directions instead of hedging on one, the trade-offs become obvious. You can't unsee the difference between "atmospheric drama" and "systematic elegance" once they're rendered side by side.

**Real code beats mockups.** Each hero component is 130-356 lines of production TypeScript. The GLSL shaders actually run on the GPU. The cursor physics actually respond to your mouse. You feel the difference between approaches in a way that a Figma frame never communicates.

**Existing components are the constraint.** All three approaches reuse the existing component library (GlowCard, GlassCard, ShimmerCard, SplitTextReveal). The question isn't "what new things do we build?" — it's "which existing pieces do we elevate?"

## What's Next

The winner gets implemented across:

- **Homepage** — full section sequence with the winning approach
- **Key pages** — /coaching, /music-lab, /products, /acos
- **Navigation** — nav style matching the winning philosophy
- **Typography** — heading weights, gradient usage, monospace accents

## FAQ

### Why compete three approaches instead of iterating on one?

Competition forces commitment to a philosophy. Iteration produces compromise. When each team goes all-in on their direction, the strengths and weaknesses become immediately visible. You pick the approach whose weaknesses you can live with.

### Do all three approaches reuse existing components?

Yes. Alpha uses GlowCard, Beta uses GlassCard, Gamma uses ShimmerCard + a new NeonCard wrapper. All three use SplitTextReveal, AuthorityBar, and the existing motion library. The differences are in how they compose and constrain these components.

### How much new code did each approach require?

Alpha: 1 new component (CosmicForgeHero, 356 lines with GLSL shaders). Beta: 2 new components (GlassCathedralHero + FeaturedWork). Gamma: 3 new components (NeonGridHero + NeonCard + CreativeShowcase). Beta has the smallest bundle impact (~0KB new deps).

### What about mobile performance?

All three approaches have mobile fallbacks. Cosmic Forge disables WebGL on mobile and shows a static gradient. Neon Grid increases dot spacing to 60px and disables cursor physics. Glass Cathedral reduces blur values by 50% to prevent `backdrop-filter` stacking issues.

### When will the winning approach ship?

After review at /design-lab/strategy, the winner gets implemented across the homepage and key pages in the same sprint. Target: within the week.
