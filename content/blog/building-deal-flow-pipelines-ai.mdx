tldr: "Build an automated deal flow pipeline that sources opportunities from RSS/APIs, screens against your investment criteria, scores deals quantitatively, and delivers weekly digests to your team — using n8n, Claude agents, and persistent memory."
faq:
  - question: "What is an automated deal flow pipeline?"
    answer: "An automated deal flow pipeline monitors funding databases, RSS feeds, and news sources for investment opportunities, then screens and scores them against your criteria automatically. Deals above threshold are queued for human review with full context."
  - question: "Why use n8n instead of Zapier for deal flow?"
    answer: "n8n offers self-hosted deployment (data stays on your infrastructure), native AI agent integration with LLM tools and memory, and complex branching logic that deal flow scoring requires. It reached a $2.5B valuation specifically because of these AI orchestration capabilities."
  - question: "How accurate is AI deal scoring?"
    answer: "AI scoring is consistent, not omniscient. It applies the same criteria to every deal without fatigue bias. The scoring framework should be calibrated against your historical investment decisions — deals you passed on vs. deals that performed. Expect 65-75% accuracy on pass/advance decisions after calibration."
  - question: "Can this work for individual angel investors?"
    answer: "Yes. The same architecture scales down: simpler scoring criteria, fewer data sources, and weekly instead of daily digests. A solo angel investor can monitor 10-20 RSS feeds and score 50+ deals per month with minimal oversight."
  - question: "What data sources feed into deal flow pipelines?"
    answer: "Common sources include Crunchbase funding alerts, PitchBook API, TechCrunch RSS, AngelList activity, SEC EDGAR filings, ProductHunt launches, and Y Combinator batch announcements. Each source gets different trust weights in the scoring system."

Venture capital firms see thousands of deals per year. Angels and solo investors see hundreds. The bottleneck isn't finding opportunities — it's systematically evaluating them without burning all your time on screening.

n8n, now valued at $2.5B after a $180M Series C, is the workflow automation platform that makes AI deal flow pipelines practical. Combined with Claude agents for intelligent scoring and persistent memory for context, you can build a system that runs continuously and gets smarter over time.

Here's the architecture.

## Pipeline Architecture

```
Data Sources → Ingestion → Screening → Scoring → Pipeline → Digest
                                                      ↓
                                               Human Review
```

Each stage is a separate workflow component that can be tested and tuned independently:

| Stage             | Tool                              | What It Does                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Ingestion**     | n8n triggers (RSS, webhook, cron) | Monitors 10-30 data sources for new deals    |
| **Deduplication** | n8n + memory                      | Checks if we've already seen this company    |
| **Screening**     | Claude agent + criteria           | Quick pass/fail against investment thesis    |
| **Scoring**       | Claude agent + scoring framework  | Quantitative 0-100 score across 7 dimensions |
| **Pipeline**      | n8n + Notion/Airtable             | Stage tracking from Sourced through Close    |
| **Digest**        | Claude agent + template           | Weekly summary to team (Slack/email)         |

## Stage 1: Data Source Ingestion

The first n8n workflow monitors your deal sources:

**RSS Feeds** (15-second setup each):

- TechCrunch Funding section
- Crunchbase funding alerts
- VentureBeat deal announcements
- Sector-specific blogs (e.g., AI, SaaS, fintech)

**API Connections** (requires credentials):

- Crunchbase API: New funding rounds in target sectors
- PitchBook: Deal alerts matching your criteria
- AngelList: New syndicates in your focus areas
- ProductHunt: Top launches in target categories

**Scheduled Scraping** (Playwright/Puppeteer):

- Y Combinator batch pages
- SEC EDGAR for S-1 filings
- Specific accelerator demo day pages

Each source pipes deals into a standardized format:

```json
{
  "company": "Acme AI",
  "sector": "Enterprise SaaS",
  "stage": "Series A",
  "raised": "$12M",
  "investors": ["Sequoia", "a16z"],
  "source": "crunchbase",
  "sourceDate": "2026-02-14",
  "url": "https://...",
  "description": "AI-powered customer support platform"
}
```

## Stage 2: Deduplication and Enrichment

Before scoring, the pipeline checks memory:

- **Already seen?** Skip if processed in the last 90 days
- **Related to an existing deal?** Flag as potential follow-on
- **In a tracked sector?** Add sector context from prior research

The enrichment step pulls additional data:

- Funding history (all rounds, total raised)
- Team LinkedIn profiles (founders, key hires)
- Product metrics (if publicly available)
- Competitor context (from memory)

## Stage 3: Quick Screen Against Criteria

A Claude agent runs a rapid pass/fail against your investment criteria:

```markdown
## My Investment Criteria

- Stage: Seed to Series B
- Sector: AI/ML, Enterprise SaaS, Developer Tools
- Geography: US, Europe
- Minimum: Product launched, some revenue signal
- Red flags: Solo non-technical founder, pivoted 3+ times
```

Deals that clearly fail criteria get tagged `PASS` with reason. Deals that clearly match get tagged `SCREEN`. Ambiguous deals get tagged `REVIEW` for human triage.

This step filters out 60-70% of inbound deals immediately.

## Stage 4: Quantitative Scoring

Deals that pass screening get scored across 7 weighted dimensions:

| Criterion          | Weight | Scoring Guide                                               |
| ------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Market Size (TAM)  | 15%    | &gt;$10B = 10, $1-10B = 7, &lt;$1B = 4                      |
| Growth Rate        | 15%    | &gt;50% YoY = 10, 20-50% = 7, &lt;20% = 4                   |
| Team Strength      | 20%    | Serial founders = 10, experienced = 7, first-time = 4       |
| Product-Market Fit | 15%    | Revenue + retention = 10, revenue only = 7, pre-revenue = 4 |
| Competitive Moat   | 15%    | Strong (network/IP) = 10, moderate = 7, weak = 4            |
| Deal Terms         | 10%    | Below market = 10, at market = 7, above = 4                 |
| Strategic Fit      | 10%    | Core thesis = 10, adjacent = 7, outside = 4                 |

The Claude agent researches each dimension and produces a score card:

```
Score: 73/100 — RECOMMEND FIRST LOOK
Market Size: 8/10 (15%) = 1.2 — $15B TAM, growing
Growth Rate: 7/10 (15%) = 1.05 — ~35% YoY
Team: 9/10 (20%) = 1.8 — Serial founder, strong CTO
PMF: 6/10 (15%) = 0.9 — Revenue but retention unclear
Moat: 7/10 (15%) = 1.05 — Data advantage, switching costs
Terms: 7/10 (10%) = 0.7 — At market for stage
Fit: 8/10 (10%) = 0.8 — Core thesis alignment
```

**Thresholds:**

- Score >= 70: Recommend Deep Dive
- Score 50-69: Conditional — needs specific data points
- Score &lt; 50: Pass with documented reason

## Stage 5: Pipeline Management

Scored deals enter a pipeline with stage tracking:

```
Sourced → Screened → First Look → Deep Dive → IC Review → Term Sheet → Closed
```

Each stage transition requires:

- **Screened → First Look**: Score >= 50, human confirms
- **First Look → Deep Dive**: Score >= 65, DD Lead initiates
- **Deep Dive → IC Review**: DD report complete, score >= 70
- **IC Review → Term Sheet**: Investment committee approval
- **Term Sheet → Closed**: Legal and final terms

The pipeline syncs to Notion (for visual kanban) or Airtable (for structured data), providing the team with a real-time view.

## Stage 6: Weekly Digest

Every Monday morning, a Claude agent compiles the week's pipeline activity:

```markdown
# Deal Flow Digest: Week of Feb 10, 2026

## Pipeline Summary

| Stage      | Count | Change |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ |
| Sourced    | 47    | +23    |
| Screened   | 12    | +8     |
| First Look | 3     | +2     |
| Deep Dive  | 1     | +0     |

## Top Scored Deals This Week

1. **Acme AI** — Score: 78/100 — AI customer support, Series A, $12M
2. **DataForge** — Score: 73/100 — Developer data tools, Seed, $4M
3. **NeuralOps** — Score: 71/100 — AI operations platform, Series A, $8M

## Deals Advanced

- Acme AI: Screened → First Look (strong PMF signals)

## Deals Passed

- FooBar Inc: Passed at Screening (solo non-technical founder)
- BazCorp: Passed at Scoring (TAM &lt; $500M)
```

This gets delivered via Slack, email (Resend), or both.

## Why This Compounds Over Time

The persistent memory layer is what transforms this from a workflow into an intelligence system:

- **Sector context grows**: Every deal analyzed adds to your sector knowledge. By deal #50, the agent has deep context on competitive dynamics, typical metrics, and market positioning.
- **Scoring calibrates**: Track which scored deals you actually invested in and how they performed. Use this to tune scoring weights.
- **Pattern recognition**: After 6 months, the system identifies patterns — "Companies in sector X with metric Y above Z tend to score well" — that inform future screening.

## Getting Started

**Minimum viable pipeline** (2-3 hours to set up):

1. 5 RSS feeds in n8n (TechCrunch, Crunchbase, 3 sector blogs)
2. Claude agent for quick screen against your criteria
3. Notion database for pipeline tracking
4. Weekly digest to your email

**Full system** (use IACOS):

1. Clone [investor-intelligence repo](https://github.com/frankxai/investor-intelligence)
2. Configure IACOS with your investment criteria
3. Connect n8n workflows for automated ingestion
4. Set up MCP servers for persistent memory and web research
5. See the [IACOS Setup Guide](/investor) for step-by-step instructions

The infrastructure investment pays for itself after the first month. One missed deal that your pipeline would have caught easily justifies the setup time.
