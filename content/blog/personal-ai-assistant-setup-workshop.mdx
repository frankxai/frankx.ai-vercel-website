## Why This Workshop?

Most people use AI like a generic chatbot. But what if your AI assistant:

- **Had access to your data** through secure connections
- **Contained your expertise** as reusable skills

That's what you'll build in this workshop.

## The Transformation

| Manual repetitive tasks | Automated workflows |
| No project context | AI knows your codebase |
| Starting over each session | Persistent knowledge |
