# MCP Server Integration: Connect ACOS to Everything

_How I extended Claude's capabilities with browser automation, image generation, and custom APIs._

---

## TL;DR

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the standard for connecting Claude to external tools. ACOS includes 7 MCP servers: Browser (Playwright), Memory (Knowledge Graph), Sequential Thinking, Lyric Genius, Nano Banana (images), and custom Creator/Database servers. This guide covers how each works, when to use them, and how to build your own MCP server in 30 minutes.

## What Is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

MCP is Anthropic's open standard for connecting AI models to external capabilities. Think of it as USB for AI—a universal way to plug in new tools.

**Without MCP:**

```
Claude → Limited to text generation
         Can't browse web
         Can't access databases
         Can't generate images
         Can't run code
```

**With MCP:**

```
Claude → MCP Server → Browser (Playwright)
      → MCP Server → Database (PostgreSQL)
      → MCP Server → Image Generator (Gemini)
      → MCP Server → Any API you build
```

### Why MCP Matters for Creators

| Capability     | Without MCP            | With MCP           |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| Web Research   | Copy-paste URLs        | Automated browsing |
| Image Creation | External tool          | Native in workflow |
| Data Storage   | Manual file management | Persistent memory  |
| Custom Tools   | Not possible           | Build anything     |

## How MCP Architecture Works

### The Communication Pattern

<Diagram
  src="/images/diagrams/blog/mcp-server-integration-guide/mcp-communication-pattern.svg"
  alt="MCP communication flow from Claude Code to Playwright MCP server and back"
  caption="Screenshot request flow: Claude routes to Browser MCP, Playwright executes, image result returns to user."
/>

### MCP Server Anatomy

Every MCP server has three components:

```typescript
// 1. TOOLS - What actions the server can perform
{
  name: "browser_navigate",
  description: "Navigate to a URL",
  parameters: {
    url: { type: "string", required: true }
  }
}

// 2. RESOURCES - Data the server exposes
{
  uri: "browser://current-page",
  description: "The current page state"
}

// 3. TRANSPORT - How Claude communicates
// Options: stdio, HTTP, WebSocket
```

---

## How to Build Your Own MCP Server

### Step 1: Create the Project

```bash
mkdir my-mcp-server
cd my-mcp-server
npm init -y
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
```

### Step 2: Define Your Tools

```typescript
// src/index.ts
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

const server = new Server(
  {
    name: "my-custom-server",
    version: "1.0.0",
  },
  {
    capabilities: {
      tools: {},
    },
  },
);

// Define a tool
server.setRequestHandler("tools/list", async () => ({
  tools: [
    {
      name: "my_custom_tool",
      description: "Does something useful",
      inputSchema: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          input: { type: "string", description: "The input" },
        },
        required: ["input"],
      },
    },
  ],
}));

// Handle tool calls
server.setRequestHandler("tools/call", async (request) => {
  if (request.params.name === "my_custom_tool") {
    const { input } = request.params.arguments;
    // Your logic here
    return {
      content: [{ type: "text", text: `Processed: ${input}` }],
    };
  }
});

// Start server
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

### Step 3: Configure in Claude Code

```json
// ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-custom-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/my-mcp-server/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Test It

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Restart Claude Code
claude

# Use your tool
"Use my_custom_tool with input 'hello world'"
```

## MCP Best Practices

### When to Use Which MCP

| Need                     | MCP Server          | Why                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Browse websites          | Browser             | Full page interaction     |
| Remember across sessions | Memory              | Persistent knowledge      |
| Complex reasoning        | Sequential Thinking | Extended chain-of-thought |
| Generate images          | Nano Banana         | High-quality visuals      |
| Create music prompts     | Lyric Genius        | Specialized for Suno      |
| Custom integrations      | Build your own      | Unlimited possibilities   |

### Performance Tips

1. **Batch browser operations** — Multiple navigations are slow; plan your path
2. **Cache in Memory MCP** — Don't research the same thing twice
3. **Use Sequential Thinking sparingly** — It's powerful but token-heavy
4. **Optimize image prompts** — Better prompts = fewer regenerations

### Security Considerations

1. **API keys in environment** — Never in code
2. **Sandbox browser sessions** — Don't log into sensitive accounts
3. **Validate MCP server sources** — Only install trusted servers
4. **Audit custom servers** — Review code before deployment

---

## Troubleshooting MCP Issues

### Server Not Connecting

```bash
# Check if server is running
ps aux | grep mcp

# Verify config path
cat ~/.claude/settings.json

# Test server directly
node /path/to/server/dist/index.js
```

### Tool Not Available

```bash
# List available tools
/mcp-status

# Check server capabilities
# Server may not expose the tool you expect
```

### Slow Performance

1. **Browser MCP** — Consider headless mode
2. **Memory MCP** — Prune old entities periodically
3. **Image generation** — Use appropriate resolution
