# Build Your First MCP Server: The Model Context Protocol Workshop

**TL;DR**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the open standard connecting AI to your data. This workshop teaches you to build production-grade MCP servers with resources, tools, and prompts.

---

## The MCP Revolution

Before MCP, every AI integration was custom. Now there's a standard:

| Before MCP | After MCP |
|------------|-----------|
| Custom integrations | Standard protocol |
| One-off solutions | Reusable servers |
| Security per integration | Built-in security |
| Vendor lock-in | Universal compatibility |

## What is MCP?

MCP lets AI models connect to your data through three primitives:

### Resources
Data exposed to the model:
- Database schemas
- File contents
- API responses

### Tools
Actions the model can take:
- Query databases
- Send messages
- Execute commands

### Prompts
Reusable templates:
- Code review prompt
- Documentation template
- Analysis framework

## Building Your First Server

Here's the basic structure:

```typescript
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js";

const server = new Server({
  name: "my-server",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

// Implement resources
server.setRequestHandler("resources/list", async () => ({
  resources: [{
    uri: "notes://all",
    name: "All Notes",
    mimeType: "application/json"
  }]
}));

// Implement tools
server.setRequestHandler("tools/list", async () => ({
  tools: [{
    name: "create_note",
    description: "Create a new note",
    inputSchema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        title: { type: "string" },
        content: { type: "string" }
      }
    }
  }]
}));
```

## Workshop Modules

1. **Fundamentals** - Protocol architecture
2. **First Server** - Build a notes server
3. **Advanced Patterns** - Resource templates, validation
4. **Production** - Security, deployment, monitoring

## Popular MCP Servers

The ecosystem is growing fast:

| Server | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **PostgreSQL** | Query databases naturally |
| **GitHub** | Manage repos and PRs |
| **Slack** | Send messages, manage channels |
| **Filesystem** | Read and write files |

## Why Learn MCP?

- **Standard protocol** - Write once, use everywhere
- **Growing ecosystem** - Hundreds of servers
- **Enterprise-ready** - Security built in
- **Future-proof** - The direction of AI integration
