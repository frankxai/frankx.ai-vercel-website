# ACOS v10: Autonomous Intelligence

*The system that gets smarter every session — with guardrails that prevent it from breaking itself.*

---

## TL;DR

ACOS v10 ships five new systems that make the Agentic Creator OS self-improving while keeping it safe. Intelligence score jumped from 72 to 93 out of 100. The key additions: Experience Replay (learning from past successes), Agent IAM (least-privilege access control), Immutable Audit Trail (every action logged), Confidence Circuit Breaker (stops cascading failures), and Conservative Self-Modify Gate (auto-reverts bad config changes). 22 curated skills, 8 specialist agents, 6 IAM-scoped profiles. Hooks optimized from 15 down to 7 for performance. [Free on GitHub](https://github.com/frankxai/agentic-creator-os).

## The Problem: Smart Systems That Break Themselves

The previous versions of ACOS were capable but fragile in one specific way: they could modify their own configuration without understanding the consequences.

A system that learns from its mistakes is useful. A system that can change its own rules based on what it learns is powerful. But a system that changes its own rules *without validating the result* is dangerous.

ACOS v9.3 scored 72/100 on our intelligence benchmark. It had solid foundations — executable routing, n-gram patterns, domain classification, quality gates. But it lacked three things:

1. **Memory of what worked before** (beyond raw pattern counts)
2. **Access control** (any agent could touch any file)
3. **Rollback safety** (config changes were permanent, even bad ones)

v10 fixes all three.

---

## The Five New Systems

### 1. Experience Replay

Every ACOS session generates a trajectory — a record of what tools were used, in what order, and whether the outcome was successful. By v10, we had 60+ trajectories stored with a 67% average success rate.

Experience Replay does something simple but powerful: when you start a new task, it finds the top 2 most similar past trajectories that succeeded and injects them as context. The system doesn't just know *what* patterns exist — it remembers *how it solved similar problems before*.

```
New task: "Deploy blog post to production"
    → Finds: deployment_traj_1771028043282 (86% success)
    → Finds: deployment_traj_1771038376009 (89% success)
    → Injects both as "here's what worked last time"
```

The result: fewer repeated mistakes, faster convergence on working solutions.

### 2. Agent IAM (Identity & Access Management)

Before v10, every agent profile had access to every tool and every directory. The music producer could edit `.claude/settings.json`. The content writer could run arbitrary bash commands. Not ideal.

Agent IAM introduces per-profile scoping:

| Profile | Can Access | Cannot Access |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| content-architect | `content/`, `components/`, `app/` | `.claude/`, system configs |
| music-producer | `content/`, `public/images/` | Bash tool, `.claude/` |
| frontend-designer | `app/`, `components/`, `lib/` | `scripts/`, `.claude-flow/` |
| technical-architect | Everything | — (full access) |
| devops-engineer | `scripts/`, `.worktrees/`, configs | `content/` |
| seo-intelligence | `content/`, `lib/seo.ts`, `data/` | `app/`, `components/` |

This is least-privilege for AI agents. Each profile gets exactly the tools and directories it needs — nothing more.

### 3. Immutable Audit Trail

Every tool use, every gate decision, every IAM violation, every config change gets logged to an append-only JSONL file. The key word is *immutable* — entries can be added but never deleted or modified.

This serves two purposes:
- **Debugging**: When something goes wrong, you can trace exactly what happened
- **Trust**: You can verify that the system did what it claims it did

The audit trail is the foundation for the next two systems.

### 4. Confidence Circuit Breaker

If an agent fails on a specific file 3 times, it gets a warning. At 5 failures, it gets restricted. At 8 failures, the circuit breaks — no more operations on that file until the session resets or a success occurs.

```
File: components/Navigation.tsx
  Attempt 1: Edit failed (syntax error) → tracked
  Attempt 2: Edit failed (wrong context) → tracked  
  Attempt 3: Edit failed (conflict) → ⚠️ WARN
  ...
  Attempt 8: → 🔴 CIRCUIT BREAK — stop touching this file
```

This prevents the most common AI failure mode: trying the same broken approach over and over, making things progressively worse.

### 5. Conservative Self-Modify Gate

The most important safety system. When ACOS modifies its own configuration:

1. **Snapshot** the current config state
2. **Apply** the change
3. **Re-score** the intelligence benchmark
4. **If score drops more than 5 points** → automatic rollback to snapshot

This means ACOS can evolve its own rules, but it can never make itself significantly dumber. The system improves monotonically, or it reverts.

## The Numbers

| Metric | v9.3 | v10 | Change |
|--------|------|-----|--------|
| Intelligence Score | 72/100 | 93/100 | +29% |
| Hook Events | 15 | 7 | -53% (performance) |
| Skills | 20 rules | 22 curated | Quality over quantity |
| Agent Profiles | 6 | 6 IAM-scoped | Access control added |
| Trajectories Stored | ~30 | 60+ | Experience grows |
| Patterns Extracted | ~25 | 50+ | Learning accelerates |

The hook reduction from 15 to 7 is a performance story. We removed informational-only hooks, consolidated tracking, and eliminated PostToolUseFailure hooks that added overhead without actionable data. Per-tool-use subprocess spawns dropped from 5-6 to 1-2.

## The Status Line

ACOS v10 ships with a new real-time status line that shows system state at a glance:

```
▊ ACOS v10  FrankX  │  ⎇ main
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⬡ Skills 22  │  ◆ Agents 8  │  ◈ Profiles 6  │  ⚡ Hooks 7
◉ Intel 93/100  │  Learn [▪▪▪▫▫] 67%  │  ▸ 50 pat  │  ▸ 61 traj  │  ○ idle
▲ Deploy READY  │  ⊕ MCP 6  │  Ctx [░░░░░] 0%
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Every metric is live. Intelligence score, learning progress, trajectory count, pattern count, deployment readiness, MCP server count, context window usage — all visible without running a command.

## Evolution: v7 → v10

The journey from v7 to v10 was a journey from *capable* to *autonomous*:

- **v7** (Feb 7): Unified orchestration. Claude-flow absorbed. 630+ skills (unvetted). Auto-routing worked but was noisy.
- **v8** (Feb 13): Curated intelligence. Pruned to 20 real skills. Exposed that "158 agents" were just session timestamps. Honest numbers.
- **v9.0** (Feb 13): Adaptive intelligence. Executable routing, n-gram patterns, domain reclassification. Learning system that actually learns.
- **v9.1-9.3** (Feb 13-14): Guardian framework. Quality gates, skill weights, verified intelligence scoring.
- **v10** (Feb 14): Autonomous intelligence. Self-improving with safety guarantees. The system that can change itself — carefully.

The honest version: v7 had inflated numbers and broken hooks. The audit (Feb 13) revealed that "630+ skills" were unvetted npm installs and "158 agents" were empty registrations. v8-v10 rebuilt on truth.

## What's Next

ACOS v10 is the foundation for what comes next:

- **Starlight Intelligence System v4** is already syncing trajectories bi-directionally — patterns flow up from ACOS, context flows down from Starlight
- **Cross-session learning** via persistent memory means ACOS gets smarter across sessions, not just within them
- **Multi-agent coordination** with IAM-scoped profiles means agents can work in parallel without stepping on each other

The goal isn't a system that replaces the creator. It's a system that remembers what worked, avoids what didn't, and gets better every time you use it.
