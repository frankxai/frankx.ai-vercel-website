## Email 1: Welcome + Free Resource (Day 0 - Immediate)

**Subject:** Your free AI tool is ready (+ what's next)

**Preheader:** Here's the resource you requested, plus what you can expect from me

**Body:**

Hey {{firstName}},

Welcome. I'm Frank.

You just signed up {{source_context}}. Here's what you requested:

{{download_link}}

**What you'll get from me:**

Every week, I send practical AI architecture insights:
- Enterprise AI system design patterns
- Production deployment strategies  
- Real implementations (not theory)

I'm an AI Architect building enterprise systems for Oracle. Before that, I shipped AI products, created 500+ AI songs, and built multi-agent orchestration systems.

No fluff. Just what works.

**Quick question:** What's your biggest AI challenge right now? Hit reply and let me know. I read every response.

## Email 2: Best Content (Day 3)

**Subject:** The 3 AI articles that changed how I build systems

**Preheader:** From reactive to systematic in 6 months

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

When I started building AI systems 2 years ago, I was reactive. Chasing trends. Rebuilding the same patterns.

Then I found structure. Here are the 3 articles that shifted everything:

**1. [Multi-Agent Orchestration: Beyond Simple Chains](/blog/multi-agent-orchestration)**
- Why single-agent systems hit scaling limits
- The 3 orchestration patterns that work in production
- Real code: LangGraph + CrewAI implementation

**2. [Production LLM Agents on OCI - Part 1: Architecture](/blog/production-llm-agents-oci-part-1-architecture)**
- How to architect agents for enterprise workloads
- Oracle Cloud patterns for reliability
- Cost optimization at scale

**3. [Oracle GenAI Agents vs LangGraph/CrewAI](/blog/oracle-genai-agents-vs-langgraph-crewai-2026)**  
- Side-by-side comparison of 3 frameworks
- When to use managed services vs custom
- Decision framework for your stack

Start with #1. It's the foundation.

## Email 3: Origin Story (Day 7)

**Subject:** How I went from developer to AI architect

**Preheader:** The 18-month journey from code to systems thinking

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

Quick story.

18 months ago, I was a developer. Good at code. Bad at systems.

I'd build features, ship projects, hit goals. But I couldn't see the architecture. Couldn't design for scale. Couldn't think in systems.

**The shift:**

1. **Stopped optimizing locally.** Realized the best component means nothing in a broken system.

2. **Started drawing diagrams.** If I couldn't explain the data flow in 3 boxes, the system was too complex.

3. **Became framework-agnostic.** LangChain, CrewAI, Oracle GenAI - they're tools. The patterns matter more.

Now I architect multi-agent systems for Oracle. Design agentic workflows that run in production. Build systems that scale.

**The resource that helped most:** The [AI Agents Architect skill](https://github.com/frankxai/ai-agents-architect). It's the mental model I wish I had 18 months ago.

Where are you in your AI journey? Hit reply - I'm curious.

## Email 4: Product Intro (Day 14)

**Subject:** The system I use to design complex AI architectures

**Preheader:** 4 weeks to clarity on any AI project

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

You've been on my list for 2 weeks. Here's what you haven't seen yet:

I built a framework called **[The Golden Path](/soulbook/golden-path)**.

It's not an AI course. It's a systematic approach to building clarity before you build systems.

**The problem it solves:**

Most AI projects fail because of unclear requirements. Not bad code.

You start building before you understand:
- What problem you're actually solving
- What "good enough" looks like  
- Where the system will break first

**The framework:**

4 weeks. 3 pillars:
1. **Awareness & Systems** - See your blind spots  
2. **Emotional Mastery** - Stay calm under pressure
3. **Purpose & Meaning** - Align work with values

It's $297. It's a workbook. You do the work, you get the clarity.

1,200+ people have used it. Most for personal development. But the systems thinking applies directly to architecture.

[Check it out](/soulbook/golden-path) if you're interested. No pressure.

— Frank

P.S. The hardest part of AI architecture isn't the code. It's knowing what to build. This helps with that.
