# Golden Path Upsell Series

4-email nurture sequence for Golden Path ($297) buyers to upsell to Life Symphony ($697).

---

## Email 1: "How's Week 1 going?" (Day 7 after purchase)

**Subject:** Quick check-in - How's your first week?

**Preheader:** Making progress on Awareness & Systems Thinking?

**Body:**

Hey {{firstName}},

You've had the Golden Path workbook for a week now.

**Quick check-in:**

How's Week 1 (Awareness & Systems Thinking) treating you?

- Clarity dashboard exercise resonating?
- Finding your patterns?
- Questions or stuck anywhere?

**Most people struggle with** identifying patterns they've normalized. If that's you, here's a tip:

Look for repeated negative outcomes in the last 6 months. Same type of conflict? Same type of failure? That's your pattern trying to show itself.

**Reply with** one pattern you've uncovered. I read every response and sometimes share anonymized insights with the community.

**Also**: If you're finding this valuable and want to go deeper, I've got something for you next week.

— Frank

P.S. Completed Week 1 already? Nice work. Week 2 (Emotional Mastery) is where it gets real.

## Email 2: "Ready to go deeper?" (Day 14 after purchase)

**Subject:** You've completed 2 weeks - here's what's next

**Preheader:** Life Symphony: Live coaching + community

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

Two weeks into the Golden Path. Impressive.

By now you've worked through:
- ✅ Awareness & Systems Thinking
- ✅ Emotional Mastery (halfway or complete)

**Here's what I'm noticing** with people who complete the Golden Path:

They get clarity. They shift patterns. But they hit a wall around Week 3-4 when life stress tests their new systems.

**The issue isn't the framework. It's doing it alone.**

### Introducing: Life Symphony ($697)

**What it is:**
- Everything in Golden Path (you already have this)
- 4 live group coaching sessions (90 minutes each)
- Private community (50 creators like you)
- 1-on-1 breakthrough session with me
- Accountability partnerships

**Why it works:**

When you're implementing Week 3 (Purpose & Meaning) and your values clash with your job... you need real-time feedback. Not "figure it out alone."

When you identify a toxic pattern but don't know how to break it... you need someone who's been there.

**This isn't for everyone:**

If the Golden Path workbook is enough, awesome. Keep going.

But if you're thinking "I need support to make this stick"... [check out Life Symphony](/soulbook/life-symphony).

**Limited to 15 people** per cohort. Next one starts March 1st.

— Frank

P.S. Already have Golden Path? I credit your $297 toward Life Symphony. You'd pay $400 (not $697).

## Email 3: "The transformation gap" (Day 21 after purchase)

**Subject:** Why most people quit at Week 3

**Preheader:** And how to not be one of them

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

Week 3 of the Golden Path is Purpose & Meaning.

**This is where most people quit.**

Not because it's hard. Because it's uncomfortable.

**Here's what happens:**

You do the ikigai exercise. You map your values. You realize your current work doesn't align with either.

Now what?

**Most people:**
- Rationalize ("it's not that bad")
- Delay ("I'll figure it out later")
- Quit ("this framework doesn't work")

**The 10% who break through:**

They have **external accountability**.

Someone who says: "You identified your purpose 2 weeks ago. What have you done about it?"

**That's the difference between knowing and doing.**

### Life Symphony: Designed for Week 3

**Month 1**: Weekly group sessions
- Week 3: Purpose alignment (the hard conversation)
- Week 4: 90-day roadmap (make it real)

**Month 2**: Implementation coaching
- Bi-weekly check-ins
- Community accountability
- 1-on-1 breakthrough session when you're stuck

**Month 3**: Integration
- Habit formation support
- Systems refinement
- Transition planning (if needed)

**Not interested?** That's fine. Complete the Golden Path solo. The framework works.

**Want support?** [Check Life Symphony details](/soulbook/life-symphony) - cohort starts March 1st.

— Frank

P.S. Your $297 credits toward the $697 price. Net cost: $400 for 3 months of coaching + community.

## Email 4: "Last chance for March cohort" (Day 28 after purchase)

**Subject:** 4 spots left - March 1st cohort

**Preheader:** Final invitation for Life Symphony

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

Final email about this.

**Life Symphony March cohort:**
- Starts: March 1st
- Duration: 12 weeks (3 months)
- Spots: 4 left (was 15)

If you've been thinking about it, decide now.

**Not sure if you need it?** Ask yourself:

1. **Did you complete Week 3** (Purpose & Meaning)?
   - Yes: Do your actions align with your stated purpose?
   - No: What's blocking you?

2. **Do you have** someone checking your progress weekly?
   - Yes: You probably don't need this.
   - No: Solo frameworks have a 15% completion rate vs 67% with accountability.

3. **Would you pay $400** for 12 weeks of structured support to ensure you actually implement what you learned?
   - Yes: [Join Life Symphony](/soulbook/life-symphony)
   - No: Finish Golden Path solo (completely valid choice)

**This is the last invite** for March. Next cohort: June.

— Frank

P.S. If you join and it's not worth it, I refund the difference ($400). You keep the Golden Path either way.

## Revenue Math

**Assumptions**:
- 100 Golden Path buyers/month
- 5% convert to Life Symphony
- Net revenue per conversion: $400 (after $297 credit)

**Monthly Upsell Revenue**: 5 × $400 = $2,000  
**Annual Upsell Revenue**: $2,000 × 12 = $24,000

**Combined with base Golden Path sales** ($44k/year at 10 sales/month):
**Total Soulbook Revenue**: $44k + $24k = **$68,000/year**
