## ⚖️ Final Recommendation

### 🥇 Winner: Tina CMS

**Why Tina wins:**
1. ✅ **Already installed** (0 setup time)
2. ✅ **Visual WYSIWYG editor** (best editing experience)
3. ✅ **$0 cost forever** (no monthly fees)
4. ✅ **Content in git** (safe, version controlled)
5. ✅ **Keeps Next.js** (full design control)
6. ✅ **Real-time preview** (see changes live)
7. ✅ **Team-friendly** (non-technical can use)
8. ✅ **Mobile editing** (works on any device)
9. ✅ **Zero vendor lock-in** (can remove anytime)
10. ✅ **Professional UI** (looks great)

### 🥈 Runner-up: Front Matter CMS

**Why Front Matter is great too:**
1. ✅ **Already configured** (0 setup time)
2. ✅ **$0 cost forever** (no monthly fees)
3. ✅ **Content in git** (safe, version controlled)
4. ✅ **Keeps Next.js** (full design control)
5. ✅ **Very fast** (instant saves)
6. ✅ **VS Code native** (if you love VS Code)
7. ✅ **Zero dependencies** (just extension)
8. ✅ **Zero vendor lock-in** (can remove anytime)

**Why not first place:**
- ❌ No mobile editing
- ❌ Less visual (see MDX syntax)
- ❌ Solo-focused (not team-friendly)

### 🚫 Don't use: Ghost CMS

**Why Ghost doesn't make sense for FrankX now:**
1. ❌ **40-120 hours migration** (huge time investment)
2. ❌ **$18/month forever** ($216/year recurring)
3. ❌ **Content leaves git** (database only)
4. ❌ **Lose Next.js** (or manage two systems)
5. ❌ **Unnecessary complexity** (you have Tina!)
6. ❌ **Newsletter not critical yet** (add later when needed)

**Ghost WOULD make sense if:**
- You had 10,000+ email subscribers
- Newsletter was 80% of your business
- You were starting from scratch (not rebuilding)
- Team of 5+ non-technical writers
- $18/month was negligible

**For FrankX now:** Ghost is overkill and expensive.
