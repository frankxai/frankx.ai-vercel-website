    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "I create content but it's not converting. Will this help?",
        "answer": "Yes. The problem isn't your content quality - it's the lack of a cohesive narrative. Creation Chronicles gives you the story architecture that transforms isolated posts into a journey people want to buy into. Most clients see engagement and conversion improvements within 45 days."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will this work if I already have a content team?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. The system makes your existing team more effective. You'll get playbooks for strategists, creators, and editors so everyone aligns around the same narrative vision. Many teams cut production time by 40% while improving quality."
      },
      {
        "question": "I'm overwhelmed by content creation. Won't this add more work?",
        "answer": "The opposite. You'll create less content that performs better. The system includes AI-assisted workflows that help you repurpose one story into multiple formats. Less grinding, more impact."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need AI tools or technical skills?",
        "answer": "No technical skills required. We show you exactly which AI tools to use (many are free) and provide copy-paste prompts. Every workflow includes both manual and AI-assisted versions so you can move at your own pace."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much time will this take to implement?",
        "answer": "Plan for a focused 90-day rollout. Most creators spend 4-6 hours per week during implementation, then the system runs itself. You'll see traction within the first 30 days using the quick-start story sprints."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between the Creator, Business, and Enterprise packages?",
        "answer": "Creator ($497) is perfect for solo creators building their first story system. Business ($997) adds advanced automation and monthly strategy for growing teams. Enterprise ($2,497) includes custom workflows and team training. Choose based on your team size and revenue goals."

      {
        "question": "Will AI automation make my content feel robotic or lose my voice?",
