Tool integration through MCP.\n\nThe docs are solid. But the docs alone won't make you effective. You need to watch people who've actually pushed it to the edges.\n\nSimon Willison explains how LLMs think when they read your file system. His \"LLM OS\" mental model is foundational — once you get it, everything about Claude Code makes more sense.\n\nFireship has the fastest breakdowns of every Anthropic feature drop. 100 seconds of Fireship saves 45 minutes of reading changelogs.\n\nThe CLAUDE.md configuration guide is the most underrated resource. One context file in your project root turns Claude from generic assistant to project-specific expert. Most people skip it. It's the highest-leverage thing you can configure.\n\nAnd the MCP server ecosystem. Tool integration is what turns Claude Code from a chat interface into infrastructure. Slack, Vercel, databases, image generation — all through a protocol most users haven't explored yet.\n\nFull curated list with learning order.\n\nhttps://frankx.ai/blog/claude-code-mastery-top-resources\n\n#ClaudeCode #DeveloperTools",
