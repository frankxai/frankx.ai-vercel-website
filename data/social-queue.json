But the pricing change is the one that reshapes production systems.\n\nOpus used to cost 5x more than Sonnet ($15/$75 vs $3/$15). You reserved it for architecture reviews and complex debugging — tasks where quality justified the premium.\n\nNow it's 1.67x Sonnet ($5/$25). A 10,000-token conversation went from $0.90 to $0.30. That's cheaper than GPT-5.2 Pro for equivalent capability. The \"is this task worth Opus?\" calculation changes for every production routing system.\n\nThree things I'm adjusting in my stack:\n\n1. Model routing — ACOS now sends 3x more tasks to Opus-tier at the same budget. Complex content, detailed code review, and research synthesis all move up from Sonnet.\n\n2. Context management — 1M tokens means loading an entire codebase or content library into a single session. Architecture reviews that required multiple fragmented sessions now happen in one pass.\n\n3. Reasoning configuration — Adaptive thinking replaces manual budget_tokens tuning. Set effort level (low/medium/high/max) and the model calibrates. budget_tokens is deprecated.\n\nBreaking changes to watch: assistant message prefilling now returns 400, output_format moved to output_config.format, beta header for interleaved thinking is deprecated.\n\nThe competitive picture: Opus 4.6 leads coding and reasoning benchmarks. Grok 4.1 and Gemini 3 Pro lead raw context at 2M. Gemini leads modality coverage.

Here's the architecture.\n\nThe problem: VCs see thousands of deals per year. Angels see hundreds. The bottleneck isn't finding opportunities — it's systematically evaluating them without burning all your time on screening.\n\nThe solution: a 6-stage pipeline using n8n for orchestration, Claude agents for intelligent scoring, and persistent memory that compounds with every deal analyzed.\n\n6 Stages:\n\n1. Ingestion — n8n monitors 10-30 data sources (Crunchbase, TechCrunch RSS, PitchBook API, ProductHunt, SEC EDGAR, Y Combinator batch pages)\n2. Deduplication — memory checks against 90-day history, flags potential follow-ons\n3. Screening — Claude agent runs rapid pass/fail against investment criteria. Filters 60-70% of inbound immediately.\n4. Scoring — 7 weighted dimensions (Market Size 15%, Growth 15%, Team 20%, PMF 15%, Moat 15%, Terms 10%, Fit 10%). Quantitative 0-100 score.\n5. Pipeline — stage tracking from Sourced through Close with defined transition requirements\n6. Digest — weekly summary to team via Slack or email\n\nWhat makes this an intelligence system, not just a workflow: persistent memory.\n\nBy deal #50, the agent has deep sector context. By deal #200, it identifies patterns across competitive dynamics and market positioning. Screening accuracy improves the longer it runs. Expect 65-75% accuracy on pass/advance decisions after calibrating against historical outcomes.\n\nThe scoring is consistent, not omniscient. Same criteria applied to every deal without fatigue bias. That consistency is the value.\n\nMinimum viable setup: 2-3 hours. 5 RSS feeds, one Claude screening agent, a Notion database, and a weekly email digest.\n\nn8n (now valued at $2.5B after $180M Series C) makes the AI orchestration practical. Combined with Claude agents for intelligent scoring, this scales from solo angel investors to institutional teams.\n\nFull architecture, scoring framework, and setup guide: frankx.ai/blog/building-deal-flow-pipelines-ai\n\nHow are you currently evaluating deal flow?

Level 5 orchestrates multiple agents on complex tasks.\n\nThe critical finding: the evolution level matters more than which agent you pick. A developer at Level 3 with any agent outperforms a Level 0 developer with the best agent available.\n\nThe full guide covers installation, configuration, MCP server architecture, and the complete evolution framework with code examples at each level:\nhttps://frankx.ai/blog/ultimate-guide-ai-coding-agents-2026",

Native Oracle Database 23ai with AI Vector Search.

Evaluate OCI GenAI Agents if you are Oracle-native and want managed simplicity\n\nFor Oracle customers: start with OCI agents for data already in Oracle Database, add LangGraph for workflows extending beyond the ecosystem.

Research produces findings, strategist produces outline, writer produces draft, editor produces final. 5 agents, 30 minutes, publication-ready.\n\n2. Parallel (Concurrent) -- multiple agents work simultaneously on independent tasks.

Weighted Synthesis (Expert Voting) -- multiple agents contribute opinions weighted by domain expertise. Strategy question: Visionary at 30%, Technical at 35%, Creation at 35%. Music question: different weights. 70% confidence threshold required for action.\n\n4. Iterative (Refinement Loops) -- output cycles through evaluation and revision until quality thresholds pass. Voice consistency 0.9, clarity 0.85, factual accuracy 0.95. Max 5 iterations. First drafts are rarely publishable. Third drafts usually are.\n\nThe critical implementation detail: context handoff happens through files, not shared memory. Every agent writes its output to disk. The next agent reads it. No information lives in hidden state. Fully debuggable and traceable.\n\nReal production comparison: single agent writing a blog post produces generic output that misses angles. Swarm with 5 specialized agents: research gathers sources, strategy identifies keywords, writer drafts with brand voice, editor polishes, SEO optimizes.
