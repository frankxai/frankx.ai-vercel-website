            "Three failure patterns I found after debugging all 18:\n\n1. Scope confusion — same server in user + project scope\n2. Silent failures — broken servers give a brief warning and vanish\n3. No tiering — every server loads every session, even the ones you use once a month",
            "mcp-doctor does in 10 seconds what took me 30 minutes:\n\n- Scans all scopes (user, project, claude.ai)\n- Health checks each server with real MCP handshakes\n- Detects duplicates and missing env vars\n- Recommends always-on vs on-demand vs remove",
            "Results on my own setup:\n\n18 servers → 5 always-on\n8 broken → 0 broken\n4 duplicates → 0 duplicates\nHealth score: 50/100 → 100/100",

          "content": "I had 18 MCP servers loading every Claude Code session.\n8 were broken. I didn't know.\n\nMCP servers are the extensibility layer that makes Claude Code powerful — browser automation, memory, image generation, Slack integration. But they accumulate silently.\n\nPlugins auto-install them. Claude.ai connectors add more. Your colleague shares a config with 5 servers you don't need. Before long, every session spawns 18 processes and half of them fail quietly.\n\nAfter spending 30 minutes manually debugging my setup, I identified three patterns that trip up every Claude Code user:\n\n1. Scope confusion — servers registered across 4 different scopes with duplicates\n2. Silent failures — broken servers show a brief warning and disappear\n3. No tiering — everything loads at startup whether you need it or not\n\nSo I built mcp-doctor. A TypeScript CLI that:\n- Scans your entire Claude Code config across all scopes\n- Health-checks each server with actual MCP handshakes\n- Detects duplicates, missing env vars, scope conflicts\n- Recommends always-on vs on-demand vs remove\n- Generates copy-paste fix commands\n\nResults on my own setup: 18 servers down to 5 always-on. Zero broken. Zero duplicates. Noticeably faster startup.\n\nIt also includes 10 preset packs (web-developer, ai-architect, content-creator, minimal, etc.) so you can start with a curated setup instead of guessing.\n\nFree and open source. Run it in 10 seconds:\nnpx mcp-doctor audit\n\nFull writeup on the blog with the technical details.\n\n#ClaudeCode #MCP #DeveloperTools #AITooling #OpenSource",

Took my setup from 18 broken servers to 5 clean always-on servers in under a minute.\n\nIt also includes 10 preset packs (web-developer, ai-architect, content-creator, etc.) so you can start with a curated setup instead of accumulating random servers over time.\n\nFree, open source, MIT licensed: npx mcp-doctor audit\n\nFull technical writeup here: https://frankx.ai/blog/mcp-doctor-claude-code-server-optimization",
