It's 5 safety systems that let the system modify its own rules without breaking itself.\n\nThe Core Problem: Every agentic system faces the same trap — the smarter it gets, the more it can modify its own configuration. Unchecked self-modification eventually makes it worse.\n\n5 Systems That Fix This:\n\n1. Experience Replay — finds 2 most similar past successes, injects as context\n2. Agent IAM — 6 profiles scoped to exactly the tools/directories they need\n3. Immutable Audit Trail — append-only JSONL logging every action\n4. Circuit Breaker — 3 failures = warning, 5 = restricted, 8 = full stop\n5. Self-Modify Gate — snapshots config, re-scores after changes, auto-reverts if score drops >5 points\n\nThe Honest Part: v7 claimed 630+ skills and 158 agents. An audit revealed 630 were unvetted npm installs and 158 were empty timestamps. v8-v10 rebuilt on verified numbers.\n\nResults: Intelligence 72→93 (+29%), Hooks 15→7 (-53%), Subprocess spawns 5-6→1-2.\n\nOpen-source: github.com/frankxai/agentic-creator-os\n\nHow are you handling self-modification safety in your agentic systems?\n\n#ArtificialIntelligence #AIEngineering #DevTools #OpenSource",

I didn't know.\n\nMCP servers are the extensibility layer that makes Claude Code powerful — browser automation, memory, image generation, Slack integration. But they accumulate silently.\n\nPlugins auto-install them. Claude.ai connectors add more. Your colleague shares a config with 5 servers you don't need. Before long, every session spawns 18 processes and half of them fail quietly.\n\nAfter spending 30 minutes manually debugging my setup, I identified three patterns that trip up every Claude Code user:\n\n1. Scope confusion — servers registered across 4 different scopes with duplicates\n2. Silent failures — broken servers show a brief warning and disappear\n3. No tiering — everything loads at startup whether you need it or not\n\nSo I built mcp-doctor. A TypeScript CLI that:\n- Scans your entire Claude Code config across all scopes\n- Health-checks each server with actual MCP handshakes\n- Detects duplicates, missing env vars, scope conflicts\n- Recommends always-on vs on-demand vs remove\n- Generates copy-paste fix commands\n\nResults on my own setup: 18 servers down to 5 always-on. Zero broken. Zero duplicates. Noticeably faster startup.\n\nIt also includes 10 preset packs (web-developer, ai-architect, content-creator, minimal, etc.) so you can start with a curated setup instead of guessing.\n\nFree and open source.
