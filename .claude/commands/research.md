## Daily Scan Protocol

When `/research` is called without parameters:

### Phase 1: Signal Collection (WebSearch)
Use the WebSearch tool to scan for the latest:

```
SEARCH QUERIES:
1. "AI agents 2026" OR "agentic AI developments"
2. "consciousness research 2026" OR "meditation science"
3. "productivity systems 2026" OR "personal development trends"
4. "Suno AI" OR "AI music generation"
5. "Claude Anthropic" OR "AI coding assistants"
```

### Phase 2: Signal Processing
For each domain, identify:
- **Breaking News**: Major announcements or releases
- **Emerging Patterns**: Trends gaining momentum
- **Research Findings**: New studies or papers
