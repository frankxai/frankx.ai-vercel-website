## Step 1: GATHER REQUIREMENTS

Ask the user or parse from their request:

**Required:**
1. **Topic**: What to visualize (e.g., "how photosynthesis works", "quantum entanglement")

**Options (with defaults):**
2. **Visual Style** (default: Standard):
   - `standard` - Clean scientific illustration
   - `minimalist` - Bauhaus, flat vector, 2-3 colors, negative space
   - `photorealistic` - Cinematic lighting, 8K, detailed textures
   - `3d` - 3D Isometric, claymorphism, studio lighting
   - `technical` - Technical Blueprint, ink sketch, annotations
   - `futuristic` - Cyberpunk HUD, neon lines, holographic
   - `vintage` - 19th century lithograph, sepia, engraving style
   - `cartoon` - Educational comic, vibrant, cel-shaded

3. **Audience Level** (default: general):
   - `elementary` - Ages 6-10, bright, simple, fun icons
   - `highschool` - Standard textbook, clean, accurate
   - `college` - Academic journal, high detail, data-rich
   - `expert` - Technical schematic, extremely dense, precise

4. **Aspect Ratio** (default: 16:9):
   - `16:9` - Widescreen (infographics, presentations)
   - `1:1` - Square (social media)
   - `9:16` - Vertical (mobile, stories)

## Step 2: RESEARCH WITH WEB GROUNDING

Use WebSearch to gather accurate, up-to-date facts:

```
WebSearch: "{topic} facts key information {current year}"
```

Extract 3-5 key facts that should inform the visual.

**Research Output Template:**
```markdown
### Research Findings for: {topic}

**Key Facts:**
1. [Fact 1 with source context]
2. [Fact 2 with source context]
3. [Fact 3 with source context]

**Visual Elements to Include:**
- [Key diagram element]
- [Important label/annotation]
- [Data/statistics to show]
```

## Step 3: CONSTRUCT THE IMAGE PROMPT

Combine research + style + audience into a detailed prompt:

**Prompt Formula:**
```
Create a {aspect_ratio} {style_description} infographic about {topic}.

VISUAL STYLE: {style_instruction}

AUDIENCE: {audience_instruction}

INCLUDE:
- {fact_1_visualized}
- {fact_2_visualized}
- {fact_3_visualized}

COMPOSITION:
- {layout_guidance}
- Text should be large and legible
- Include clear labels and annotations
```

**Style Instructions (copy verbatim):**

| Style | Instruction |
|-------|-------------|
| `standard` | High-quality digital scientific illustration. Clean, modern, highly detailed. Professional color palette. |
| `minimalist` | Bauhaus Minimalist. Flat vector art, limited color palette (2-3 colors), reliance on negative space and simple geometric shapes. |
| `photorealistic` | Photorealistic Composite. Cinematic lighting, 8k resolution, highly detailed textures. Looks like a photograph. |
| `3d` | 3D Isometric Render. Claymorphism or high-gloss plastic texture, studio lighting, soft shadows, looks like a physical model. |
| `technical` | Da Vinci Notebook style. Ink on parchment sketch, handwritten annotation style, rough but accurate lines, technical precision. |
| `futuristic` | Cyberpunk HUD. Glowing neon blue/cyan lines on dark background, holographic data visualization, 3D wireframes. |
| `vintage` | 19th Century Scientific Lithograph. Engraving style, sepia tones, textured paper background, fine hatch lines. |
| `cartoon` | Educational Comic. Vibrant colors, thick outlines, expressive cel-shaded style, engaging and fun. |

**Audience Instructions:**

| Level | Instruction |
|-------|-------------|
| `elementary` | Target: Ages 6-10. Bright, simple, fun. Large clear icons and minimal text labels. |
| `highschool` | Target: High School. Standard textbook style. Clean lines, clear labels, accurate diagrams. |
| `college` | Target: University. Academic journal style. High detail, data-rich, precise schematics. |
| `expert` | Target: Industry Expert. Technical blueprint. Extremely dense detail, precise annotations. |

## Step 4: GENERATE IMAGE WITH NANO BANANA

Call the Nano Banana MCP with grounding enabled:

```javascript
mcp__nanobanana__generate_image({
  prompt: "{constructed_prompt}",
  aspect_ratio: "16:9", // or 1:1, 9:16
  model_tier: "pro",
  enable_grounding: true,
  thinking_level: "high",
  resolution: "high"
})
```

**Key Parameters:**
- `enable_grounding: true` - Uses Google Search for factual accuracy
- `model_tier: "pro"` - Best quality for complex infographics
- `thinking_level: "high"` - Better reasoning for accurate visuals

## Step 5: PRESENT RESULTS

Show the user:
1. Generated image
2. Research sources used
3. Key facts included
4. Offer to regenerate with different style

**Output Template:**
```markdown
## 🎨 InfoGenius Generated: {topic}

**Style:** {style} | **Audience:** {audience} | **Aspect:** {aspect_ratio}

AUDIENCE: Target: University. Academic journal style. High detail, data-rich, precise schematics.

INCLUDE:
- Chain of connected blocks showing linked hashes
- Visualization of distributed nodes across network
- Transaction flow from initiation to block confirmation
- Consensus mechanism representation (nodes voting)

COMPOSITION:

- Clean white/blue color scheme
- Text labels should be large and legible
- Show data flow with directional arrows
```

**Step 4 - Generate:**
```javascript
mcp__nanobanana__generate_image({
  prompt: "{above_prompt}",
  aspect_ratio: "16:9",
  model_tier: "pro",
  enable_grounding: true,
  thinking_level: "high",
  resolution: "high"
