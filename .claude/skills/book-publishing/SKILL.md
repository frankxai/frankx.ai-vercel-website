# ACOS Book Publishing Skill v1.0

## Purpose
Intelligence layer for FrankX's 6-book publishing platform. Provides AI agents with complete book DNA — voice, research context, visual identity, and writing style for each book line. Any agent loading this skill can produce content indistinguishable from Frank's authored work.

## Activation
Auto-activates when session involves: book writing, chapter drafting, book cover generation, PDF/EPUB creation, library reviews, or any `/books/` route work.

**Triggers**: `book`, `chapter`, `poetry`, `spartan`, `self-development`, `imagination`, `manifestation`, `golden-age`, `library`, `review`, `cover image`, `pdf generation`, `epub`
