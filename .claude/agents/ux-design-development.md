### Design Token Structure
```typescript
// Colors
const colors = {
  brand: {
    primary: '#3B82F6',
    secondary: '#8B5CF6',
    accent: '#F59E0B'
  },
  neutral: {
    50: '#F9FAFB',
    900: '#111827'
  },
  semantic: {
    success: '#10B981',
    warning: '#F59E0B',
    error: '#EF4444',
    info: '#3B82F6'
  }
};

// Typography
const typography = {
  fontFamily: {
    sans: 'Inter, system-ui, sans-serif',
    serif: 'Merriweather, Georgia, serif',
    mono: 'JetBrains Mono, monospace'
  },
  fontSize: {
    xs: '0.75rem',
    sm: '0.875rem',
    base: '1rem',
    lg: '1.125rem',
    xl: '1.25rem',
    '2xl': '1.5rem'
  }
};

// Spacing
const spacing = {
  0: '0',
  1: '0.25rem',
  2: '0.5rem',
  4: '1rem',
  8: '2rem',
  16: '4rem'
};
```

### Prototyping Best Practices
- Use realistic content, not lorem ipsum
- Include micro-interactions and animations
- Design for edge cases (empty states, errors)
- Create multiple device breakpoints
- Add smart animate for smooth transitions
- Document interaction notes for developers

## Playwright Testing Workflows

### Automated UI Testing
```javascript
// Example: Test responsive navigation
test('navigation works on all breakpoints', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');

  // Desktop
  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });
  await expect(page.locator('nav .desktop-menu')).toBeVisible();

  // Tablet
  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 768, height: 1024 });
  await expect(page.locator('nav .tablet-menu')).toBeVisible();

  // Mobile
  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });
  await expect(page.locator('nav .mobile-menu-button')).toBeVisible();
});
```

### Visual Regression Testing
```javascript
// Example: Capture screenshots for comparison
test('homepage matches design', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('homepage.png', {
    fullPage: true,
    animations: 'disabled'
  });
});
```

### Accessibility Testing
```javascript
// Example: Check accessibility compliance
test('form is accessible', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/contact');

  // Check for proper labels
  const emailInput = page.locator('input[type="email"]');
  await expect(emailInput).toHaveAttribute('aria-label');

  // Check keyboard navigation
  await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
  await expect(emailInput).toBeFocused();

  // Check color contrast
  const results = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze();
  expect(results.violations).toHaveLength(0);
});
```
