## Common Questions

**Q: Should I implement all at once or incrementally?**
A: Incrementally. Ship Week 1 changes, monitor, adjust, then continue. Gradual rollout reduces risk.

**Q: What if I don't have testimonials yet?**
A: Start with 3 (can use existing positive feedback/emails), add more over time. Don't block on this.

**Q: Can I skip the assessment page?**
A: It's high impact but time-intensive. If pressed for time, do everything else first, add assessment in Week 6-7.

**Q: What about existing content/pages?**
A: All existing URLs preserved. No broken links. This is enhancement, not replacement.

**Q: How do I know if V5 is working?**
A: Compare against success metrics. Set up analytics Week 1, review weekly, adjust monthly.

**Q: What if my brand voice is different?**
A: Use the strategic structure and frameworks, but adapt copy to your authentic voice. The thinking matters more than exact words.

**Q: Do I need all four documents?**
A: Yes for complete understanding. But if time-limited: Read strategy first, reference others as needed during implementation.

**Q: Can I share these docs with a developer?**
A: Absolutely. They're written to be handed off. Developer can follow wireframes and checklist directly.

## Key Principles to Remember

1. **Value first, products subtle** - Lead with what you give, not what you sell
2. **Social proof everywhere** - Trust is built constantly, not once
3. **Clear next steps always** - Every page/section ends with action
4. **Cinematic but clear** - Inspiring language, but always understandable
5. **Mobile is primary** - Half your audience is on phone, optimize for it
6. **Data over opinions** - Let analytics guide iteration
7. **Ship and iterate** - Progress over perfection, always
8. **Every word earns its place** - If it doesn't hook, build trust, or guide action, cut it
