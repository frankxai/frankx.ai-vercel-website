**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
500+ AI songs later, here's what actually works in Suno.

Most prompts fail because people treat it like ChatGPT.

It's not. Here's the difference:

**Tweet 2:**
The key insight:

Suno doesn't follow instructions.
It captures vibes.

"Make the drums louder" → Won't work
"Powerful driving drums" → Works

Describe the feeling, not the action.

**Tweet 3:**
The formula that works:

Genre + Tempo + Instruments + Vocals + Mood + Special Elements

Weak: "rock song with guitar"

Strong: "indie rock, driving energy, clean electric guitar arpeggios, raspy tenor vocals, nostalgic triumphant"

**Tweet 4:**
Genre specificity matters:

Don't say: "electronic"
Say: "deep house" or "synthwave" or "ambient techno"

Don't say: "rock"
Say: "indie rock" or "arena rock" or "post-punk"

Specific = better results.

**Tweet 5:**
Tempo/Energy words:

Low: slow, gentle, peaceful, ambient, dreamy
Medium: steady, groovy, flowing, moderate
High: fast, driving, intense, explosive, frenetic

These set the pace more than BPM numbers.

**Tweet 6:**
Instrument specificity:

Weak: "guitar and drums"

Strong: "clean electric guitar arpeggios, tight snare, deep 808 bass, atmospheric synth pads"

Tell it what kind of sound, not just what instrument.

**Tweet 7:**
Vocal styles that work:

- "ethereal female soprano"
- "raspy male tenor"
- "whispered intimate"
- "belting powerful"
- "layered harmonies"

"Female vocals" is too vague.

**Tweet 8:**
Special elements for uniqueness:

- "528Hz healing frequency"
- "lo-fi vinyl crackle"
- "orchestral swells"
- "choir harmonies"
- "nature sounds"

These make tracks distinctive.

**Tweet 9 (CTA):**
Template I use for every track:

[genre], [tempo], [2-3 instruments], [vocal style], [2-3 mood words]
