## Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
What I learned building a 40+ agent system.

No single agent needs to be perfect.

The swarm produces better results than any individual.

Here's how:

**Tweet 2:**
Single agent writing:
"Write a blog post about AI"
→ Generic, no depth, misses angles

Swarm writing:
→ Research Agent gathers sources
→ Strategy Agent plans structure
→ Writer Agent drafts in voice
→ Editor Agent reviews
→ SEO Agent optimizes

Result: Publishable, first try.

**Tweet 3:**
Pattern 1: Pipeline (Sequential)

Research → Plan → Create → Edit → Publish

Each agent hands off to the next.

Best for: content creation, data processing, linear workflows.

70% of use cases.

**Tweet 4:**
Pattern 2: Parallel (Concurrent)

[Agent A | Agent B | Agent C] → Synthesis

Multiple agents work simultaneously.

Best for: time-sensitive tasks, independent subtasks.

Add this when you hit speed bottlenecks.

**Tweet 5:**
Pattern 3: Weighted Synthesis

3 agents answer the same question.
Orchestrator weighs their responses.

Best for: important decisions, reliability needs.

Multiple perspectives > single opinion.

**Tweet 6:**
Pattern 4: Iterative (Loops)

Writer → Critic → Writer → Critic

Loop continues until quality threshold met.

Best for: quality-sensitive content, creative work.

Built-in improvement cycles.

**Tweet 7:**
You don't need all 4 patterns.

Start with Pipeline. Handles most cases.

Add Parallel when speed matters.
Add Weighted when reliability matters.
Add Iterative when quality matters most.
