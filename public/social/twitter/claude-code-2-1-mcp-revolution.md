**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Here's what I found in Claude Code 2.1.

The biggest productivity upgrade since launch.

Not hype. Numbers.

**Tweet 2:**
The problem I had:

7 MCP servers connected.
144,802 tokens consumed by tool definitions.
Context nearly exhausted before I typed anything.

That's not usable. That's context pollution.

**Tweet 3:**
Anthropic shipped MCP Tool Search.

Before: 77,000 tokens consumed upfront
After: 8,700 tokens (lazy loading)

85% reduction.

Not incremental improvement. Step change.

**Tweet 4:**
Why this matters:

Before: Carefully choose which servers to connect. Every tool costs context.

After: Connect everything. Claude discovers what's relevant.

The constraint shifted completely.

**Tweet 5:**
Other things in 2.1:

Hooks that modify tool inputs BEFORE execution.

- Auto-add --dry-run to dangerous commands
- Redact secrets before terminal
- Enforce commit message formats

This is how you build guardrails that don't break flow.

**Tweet 6:**
Skills hot reload.

Create a skill → immediately available.
Edit a skill → changes apply instantly.

No restart. No session loss.

Finally real iteration speed.

**Tweet 7:**
The accuracy gains:

Opus 4 accuracy: 49% → 74%
Opus 4.5 accuracy: 79.5% → 88.1%

Fewer tools loaded = cleaner context = better reasoning.

**Tweet 8:**
1,096 commits in the 2.1.x series.

The team is shipping fast. Very fast.

If you're not on 2.1 yet, you're leaving performance on the table.
