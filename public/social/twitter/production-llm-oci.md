## Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
90% of GenAI projects fail in production.

Not because of bad models.

Because of missing operating models 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The inversion most teams miss:

POC: 90% model, 10% operations
Production: 25% model, 75% operations

The model is a dependency.
The operating model is the product.

**Tweet 3:**
5-Stage Maturity Framework:

1. Experimental - ad hoc
2. Managed - basic monitoring
3. Defined - automated pipelines
4. Quantified - SLOs + incident response
5. Optimizing - self-healing

Most orgs stuck at Stage 1-2.

**Tweet 4:**
Key components most teams skip:

→ Evaluation pipelines (not just vibes)
→ Cost attribution per use case
→ Incident response runbooks
→ Model deprecation planning
