## Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I built my own JARVIS.

Not a chatbot. An actual intelligence system that:
- Knows my projects
- Remembers my preferences
- Executes complex workflows

Took 3 weeks to figure out. Here's the architecture:

**Tweet 2:**
The problem with ChatGPT, Gemini, etc:

Every conversation starts from zero.

You spend 30% of each session re-explaining context.

That's not intelligence partnership. That's expensive rubber-ducking.

**Tweet 3:**
Your Jarvis needs three layers:

Layer 1: Knowledge (CLAUDE.md file)
Layer 2: Execution (Skills + MCP servers)
Layer 3: Intelligence (Pattern learning)

Let me break each down:

**Tweet 4:**
Layer 1: Knowledge

One file called CLAUDE.md in your project root.

It holds:
- Your current projects
- Your coding preferences
- Your past decisions

Claude reads it automatically. Context preserved forever.

**Tweet 5:**
Layer 2: Execution

Skills = reusable workflows.

I built:
- /publish → full blog pipeline
- /deploy → staging to production
- /research → deep dive with sources

One command. Complete execution. No babysitting.

**Tweet 6:**
Layer 3: Intelligence

The system learns.

Every decision documented.
Every workflow optimized.

In 30 days, it knew my patterns better than I did.

**Tweet 7:**
What I manage through natural language:

- 12,000+ AI-generated songs
- Full website (this one)
- Enterprise consulting projects

"Publish the agent roadmap article"

It writes, optimizes, generates images, deploys.

**Tweet 8:**
The stack is surprisingly simple:

- Claude Code (free CLI)
- CLAUDE.md (one markdown file)
- MCP servers (local tool connections)

No enterprise contracts. No fancy infrastructure.

**Tweet 9 (CTA):**
