## Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
MCP servers are the new APIs.

Model Context Protocol is how Claude connects to external tools.

USB for AI.

Here's how it works:

**Tweet 2:**
Without MCP:
Claude → Limited to text

With MCP:
Claude → Browser automation
Claude → Database queries
Claude → Image generation
Claude → Any API you build

The possibilities opened up completely.

**Tweet 3:**
The 7 servers I run:

1. Browser (Playwright) - Full web automation
2. Memory - Persistent knowledge graph
3. Sequential Thinking - Structured reasoning
4. Nano Banana - Image generation
5. Notion - Knowledge base sync
6. Gmail - Email automation
7. Custom APIs - Whatever I need

**Tweet 4:**
Browser (Playwright) is the game changer:

"Take a screenshot of the GitHub README"

Claude:
- Opens browser
- Navigates to URL
- Takes screenshot
- Returns image

No context switching. No copy-paste.

**Tweet 5:**
Memory server changed how I work:

Claude remembers across sessions.

"Remember I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript"

Next session: It still knows.

No more re-explaining context every time.

**Tweet 6:**
The Claude Code 2.1 upgrade:

Before: 77K tokens consumed by MCP tools at startup
After: 8.7K tokens (lazy loading)

85% reduction.

Now you can connect everything without penalty.

**Tweet 7:**
Building your own server:

Takes 30 minutes.
Standard Node.js.
Clear MCP spec.

Define tools → Handle requests → Return results.

Any API becomes an MCP server.

**Tweet 8 (CTA):**
