## Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
7 patterns that separate toy demos from production agents.

Analyzed AWS, Google, Azure, OpenAI, Anthropic, Oracle.

They all converge on the same framework:

**Tweet 2:**
Pillar 1: Orchestration

Agents rarely work alone.

Supervisor-specialist. Swarm. Pipeline.

Pick your pattern. Multi-agent coordination is table stakes.

**Tweet 3:**
Pillar 2: Memory

LLMs are stateless.

Without memory:
- Can't learn
- Can't remember context
- Can't maintain conversations

You need: short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic.

**Tweet 4:**
Pillar 3: Guardrails

Production demands predictable behavior.

- Input validation
- Output filtering
- Behavioral boundaries

Agents with tools need constraints.

**Tweet 5:**
Pillar 4: Observability

Can't improve what you can't measure.

- Tracing
- Logging
- Cost tracking per task

When an agent fails at 3am, you need to know why.

**Tweet 6:**
Pillar 5: Security

Agents with tools are attack surfaces.

- Principle of least privilege
- Audit trails
- Secret management

Every tool call is a potential vulnerability.

**Tweet 7:**
Pillar 6: Cost Management

Agentic workflows consume 10-100x more tokens than chat.

- Token budgets
- Circuit breakers
- Fallback models

Or you'll get surprised bills.

**Tweet 8:**
Pillar 7: Lifecycle (AgentOps)

Agents are software. Treat them that way.

- Version control
- Testing
- CI/CD
- Rollback capability

**Tweet 9 (CTA):**
Gartner: 40% of enterprise apps will include AI agents by end of 2026.

Companies that understand these pillars will ship.

The rest will keep building demos.
