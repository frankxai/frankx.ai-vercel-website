## Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Every creator wants their own Jarvis.

Not another chat tool that forgets everything.

A real AI partner that knows your work and gets smarter every day.

Here's how to build one (it's free) 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The problem with ChatGPT, Gemini, etc:

• Designed for everyone = optimized for no one
• Every conversation starts from zero
• Doesn't know your projects
• Doesn't know your style
• You spend 30% re-explaining context

That's not intelligence. That's expensive rubber-ducking.

**Tweet 3:**
Your Jarvis has 3 layers:

Layer 1: KNOWLEDGE
→ CLAUDE.md context file
→ Your projects, preferences, decisions

Layer 2: EXECUTION
→ MCP servers (files, deployment, email)
→ Skills for repeated workflows

Layer 3: INTELLIGENCE
→ Pattern recognition
→ Continuous learning

**Tweet 4:**
The difference:

Generic AI:
• Forgets everything
• Generic responses
• One task at a time
• You adapt to it

Your Jarvis:
• Remembers your work
• Your voice, your style
• Orchestrates workflows
• Adapts to you

**Tweet 5:**
I use this exact system to manage:

• 12,000+ AI-generated songs
• This entire website
• Enterprise consulting

It started with a single CLAUDE.md file.

30 days later: personal AI operating system.

**Tweet 6 (CTA):**
Full build guide (free):

• 3-layer architecture
• MCP server setup
• Skill templates
• Weekly update ritual

Stop using AI tools like everyone else.
Build a system that knows YOU.
