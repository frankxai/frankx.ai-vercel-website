## Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
72% of enterprise AI projects now use multi-agent architectures.

Up from 23% in 2024.

The question isn't "can AI help?" anymore.

It's "how do we orchestrate agent ecosystems?"

Here's the 2026 roadmap 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The market speaks:

• AI agents: $5.4B (2024) → $52B by 2030
• 45.8% CAGR
• 40% of enterprise apps will embed agents by EOY 2026

This isn't hype. It's infrastructure.

**Tweet 3:**
The 2026 Stack:

• LangGraph → Stateful workflows
• CrewAI → Team coordination
• MCP Protocol → Universal tool integration
• OCI GenAI → 50+ pre-built enterprise agents

Single agents are demos.
Agent ecosystems are products.

**Tweet 4:**
Three operating systems emerging:

1. Vibe OS
   → Music + experiential storytelling

2. Agentic Creator OS
   → Campaigns, copy, distribution

3. Enterprise Intelligence
   → Governance, change management, ROI

Pick your lane. Build your system.

**Tweet 5:**
What this means for YOU:

Creators: AI collaboration is table stakes. Differentiate through curation + community.

Executives: Pilots ≠ strategy. Boards want governance + measurable ROI.

Builders: Master orchestration or get orchestrated.
