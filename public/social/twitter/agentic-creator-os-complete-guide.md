## Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I automated 80% of my content workflow.

25 commands. 80+ skills. 40+ agents. 8 workflows.

No code required.

Here's the system:

**Tweet 2:**
The problem it solves:

Most creators use AI like this:
1. Open ChatGPT
2. Write prompt
3. Get response
4. Copy-paste
5. Repeat (losing context)

Tool roulette. Prompt amnesia. Nothing compounds.

**Tweet 3:**
What ACOS does:

Transforms Claude Code from chat tool to operating system.

- Persistent skills
- Coordinated agents
- Automated workflows

Same system runs my music (12K songs), website, and enterprise work.

**Tweet 4:**
The entry point:

```
/acos
```

One command. Smart router detects your intent. Routes to the right workflow automatically.

"I need to publish the agent roadmap article" → Full pipeline triggers.

**Tweet 5:**
What happens when I say "/publish enterprise-agent-roadmap":

1. Writer drafts in my voice
2. SEO optimizes structure
3. Image generator creates hero
4. Deploy pushes to Vercel
5. Social creates LinkedIn/Twitter posts

One command. Everything executes.

**Tweet 6:**
The skill architecture:

Skills are saved capabilities.

I have 80+:
- /research (deep dive with sources)
- /publish (full blog pipeline)
- /music (Suno production)
- /deploy (staging to production)

Each one compounds over time.

**Tweet 7:**
The hooks system:

Quality gates that run automatically.

- Before file writes: Check formatting
- After code: Run tests
- Before publish: SEO validation

Mistakes caught before they ship.

**Tweet 8:**
The numbers after 8 months:

- 12,000+ AI songs produced
- 50+ blog articles published
- 3 enterprise projects managed

All through natural language commands.

**Tweet 9 (CTA):**
Free. Open source. Installs in 5 minutes.
