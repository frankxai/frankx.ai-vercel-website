**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Your org chart is a tomb.

VP approves. Director assigns. Manager tracks.

Then you wonder why your $2M AI investment moves at human speed.

Here's what actually works:

**Tweet 2:**
I spent 6 months watching enterprises fail at this.

They "add AI" to existing structures.

Like putting a jet engine on a horse-drawn carriage.

The problem isn't the AI. It's the org design.

**Tweet 3:**
The unit of scale in 2026 isn't the "team."

It's the graph.

Three nodes. That's the whole architecture:

**Tweet 4:**
Node 1: Context
→ Holds the goal
→ Breaks it into 50 parallel tasks
→ Maintains state

This replaces your project manager + 47 status meetings.

**Tweet 5:**
Node 2: Execution
→ Deep, narrow skills
→ Runs everything PARALLEL
→ No sequential approval chains

This is why AI moves in minutes while you move in days.

**Tweet 6:**
Node 3: Verification
→ The critic
→ Rejects 30% of output
→ Forces retry loops

This is your quality gate that never sleeps, never gets tired, never rubber-stamps.

**Tweet 7:**
Real numbers from a system I built last quarter:

Old flow: 96 hours
(4 days of meetings, reviews, fixes)

New flow: 24 minutes
(automated iteration)

Same quality. 240x faster.

**Tweet 8:**
The metric that matters:

Cognitive Velocity

How fast can a novel idea traverse your system and become shipped reality?

Measured in weeks? You're bleeding talent.
Measured in months? Your competitors already won.

→ LangGraph patterns
→ CrewAI integration
→ MCP orchestration
