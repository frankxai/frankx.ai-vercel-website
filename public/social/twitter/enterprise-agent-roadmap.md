## Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Your org chart is a tomb.

VP → Director → Manager → Junior

This hierarchy was built for humans who sleep and type at 50 WPM.

AI agents think at the speed of light.

Stop putting a Ferrari engine inside a horse. 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The unit of scale in 2026 isn't the "Team."

It's the Graph.

Agents (Nodes) talking directly to each other (Edges), governed by shared Protocol.

No status meetings. No approval chains. Just execution.

**Tweet 3:**
The Fractal Triad—your new building block:

1. Context Node (Brain)
   → Understands goal, breaks into sub-tasks

2. Execution Node (Hands)
   → Deep skills, runs PARALLEL not sequential

3. Verification Node (Eyes)
   → The Critic, rejects 30%, forces retry

**Tweet 4:**
Traditional company:
• Day 1: Junior writes code
• Day 2: Manager reviews
• Day 3: Fixes
• Day 4: Director approves
→ 96 hours

Fractal company:
• Context defines spec
• Execution writes
• Verification rejects/approves
• Retry loop
→ 24 minutes

**Tweet 5:**
New metric: Cognitive Velocity

How fast can a novel idea traverse your graph and become shipped reality?

• Measured in days? Safe.
• Measured in weeks? Dying.
• Measured in months? Already dead.

**Tweet 6 (CTA):**
