## Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I tested every major AI coding agent.

Claude Code. OpenCode. Cline. Roo Code. Kilo Code.

Same tasks. Same codebase.

Here's what I found:

**Tweet 2:**
First, what these agents actually are:

Not chatbots that write code.

Autonomous systems that:
- Read your entire codebase
- Execute terminal commands
- Handle multi-step tasks
- Connect to external tools

Different beast entirely.

**Tweet 3:**
The comparison:

Claude Code → Best MCP support, tightest Claude integration
OpenCode → Most customizable, open source
Cline → Best VS Code experience
Roo Code → Multi-model experimentation
Kilo Code → Lightweight, quick tasks

**Tweet 4:**
Winner for most people: Claude Code.

Works out of the box.
Best documentation.
Anthropic actively shipping features.

But the tool matters less than how you configure it.

**Tweet 5:**
A raw Claude Code installation: 40% effective.

Add CLAUDE.md context: 70% effective.

Add skills + MCP servers: 90%+ effective.

The configuration IS the product.

**Tweet 6:**
Every agent follows the same architecture:

Perceive → Reason → Act → Feedback

What you feed it determines what you get.

Most people skip the "feed it" part.

**Tweet 7:**
The evolution path I recommend:

Level 1: CLAUDE.md (knowledge layer)
Level 2: skill.md (reusable workflows)
Level 3: agent.md (autonomous handlers)

Master each before moving up.

**Tweet 8:**
Don't try to build everything in a weekend.

I've watched people burn out that way.

Small iterations compound.

One file. One skill. One server at a time.
