## Post Copy

Every creator and founder I talk to wants the same thing:

"I want my own Jarvis."

Not another chat tool that forgets everything.

A true intelligence partner that:
• Knows your projects intimately
• Remembers your preferences
• Executes complex workflows automatically
• Gets smarter every day

Here's what most AI tutorials won't tell you:

The technology already exists. You just need to wire it together.

The Architecture (3 Layers):

**Layer 1: Knowledge**
→ CLAUDE.md context file
→ Your projects, preferences, decisions
→ Updates weekly with new learnings

**Layer 2: Execution**
→ MCP servers for file ops, deployment, email
→ Skills for repeated workflows
→ Automated pipelines

**Layer 3: Intelligence**
→ Pattern recognition
→ Continuous improvement
→ Adapts to your style

Generic AI vs Your Jarvis:

| Generic AI | Your Jarvis |
|------------|-------------|
| Forgets everything | Remembers your work |
| Generic responses | Your voice, your style |
| One task at a time | Orchestrates workflows |
| You adapt to it | It adapts to you |

I use this system to manage 12,000+ songs, this website, and enterprise consulting.

30 days to build. Free on GitHub.
