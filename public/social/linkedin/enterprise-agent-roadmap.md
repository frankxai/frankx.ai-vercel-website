Your org chart is a tomb.

I spent 6 months watching enterprises try to "add AI" to their existing structures.

VP approves. Director assigns. Manager tracks. Junior executes.

Then they wonder why their $2M AI investment moves at human speed.

Here's what I learned building agent systems that actually ship:

The unit of scale isn't the team. It's the graph.

Three nodes. That's it:

1. Context Node — holds the goal, breaks it into 50 parallel tasks, maintains state

2. Execution Node — deep narrow skills, runs everything simultaneously (not sequentially like your approval chain)

3. Verification Node — the critic that rejects 30% and forces retry loops

Real numbers from a system I architected last quarter:

Old flow: 96 hours (4 days of meetings, reviews, fixes)
New flow: 24 minutes (automated iteration)

The metric nobody's tracking but should be:

Cognitive Velocity — how fast can a novel idea traverse your system and become shipped reality?

If yours is measured in weeks, you're bleeding talent.
If it's measured in months, your competitors already won.

I wrote the full implementation patterns (LangGraph + CrewAI + MCP) here:

What's your current idea-to-ship velocity?
