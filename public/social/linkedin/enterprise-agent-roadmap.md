## Post Copy

Your org chart is a tomb.

VP → Director → Manager → Junior → Intern

This pyramid was designed for humans who sleep, forget things, and communicate at 50 words per minute.

Your AI agents think at the speed of light and talk in JSON.

Forcing them into human hierarchies is putting a Ferrari engine inside a horse.

Here's what works instead: The Fractal Triad

Every function—Marketing, Engineering, Legal—runs on this 3-node cell:

**1. Context Node (The Brain)**
Understands the goal. Breaks it into 50 sub-tasks. Holds state.

**2. Execution Node (The Hands)**
Deep, narrow skills. Runs tasks in PARALLEL, not sequential.

**3. Verification Node (The Eyes)**
The Critic. Rejects 30% of work. Forces retry loops.

The result?

Traditional company: 96 hours (4 days of back-and-forth)
Fractal company: 24 minutes (automated iteration)

The metric that matters in 2026 isn't "hours worked."

It's Cognitive Velocity: How fast can a novel idea traverse your graph and become a shipped reality?

If yours is measured in weeks, you're dying.
If it's measured in months, you're already dead.

Tear down the pyramid. Build the graph.
