I tested every major AI coding agent.

Claude Code. OpenCode. Cline. Roo Code. Kilo Code.

Spent weeks setting up each one, running the same tasks, comparing results.

Here's what I found:

The landscape has shifted. These aren't chatbots that write code. They're autonomous systems that can read your entire codebase, execute terminal commands, and handle multi-step tasks like "refactor auth to use JWT" without babysitting.

The winner for most users: Claude Code.

Best MCP support. Tightest Claude integration. Works out of the box.

But here's what most guides miss:

The tool matters less than how you configure it.

Every agent follows the same architecture:
Perceive → Reason → Act → Feedback loop

The difference is what you feed it.

A raw Claude Code installation is maybe 40% effective. Add CLAUDE.md context? 70%. Add skills and MCP servers? 90%+.

The evolution path I recommend:

Level 1: CLAUDE.md (your knowledge layer)
Level 2: skill.md (reusable workflows)
Level 3: agent.md (autonomous task handlers)

Start with one. Master it. Then evolve.

Don't try to build the whole system in a weekend. I've watched people burn out that way. Small iterations compound.

Which coding agent are you using? What's your setup?
