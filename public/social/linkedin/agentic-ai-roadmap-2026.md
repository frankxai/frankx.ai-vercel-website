## Post Copy

72% of enterprise AI projects now use multi-agent architectures.

Up from 23% in 2024.

The shift isn't "can AI help?" anymore.

It's "how do we orchestrate agent ecosystems?"

Here's the 2026 landscape:

**The Numbers:**
• AI agents market: $5.4B (2024) → $52B (2030)
• 45.8% CAGR
• 40% of enterprise apps will embed agents by EOY 2026

**The Stack:**
• LangGraph for stateful workflows
• CrewAI for team coordination
• MCP protocol for universal tool integration
• OCI GenAI Agents with 50+ pre-built agents

**The Three Operating Systems:**

1. Vibe OS → Music and experiential storytelling
2. Agentic Creator OS → Campaigns, copy, distribution
3. Enterprise Intelligence → Governance, change management, ROI

**What this means:**

For Creators: AI collaboration is baseline. Your differentiator is curation, brand, and community.

For Executives: Pilots aren't strategy. Boards expect governance, risk mitigation, measurable ROI.

For Everyone: The teams that master orchestration will outpace teams still debating adoption.
