Agentic AI integration isn't about installing copilots.

It's about building an operating system that keeps values, governance, and business outcomes synchronized.

The 7-Layer Framework:

1. Purpose & Principles (Signal)
2. Audience Research (Empathy)
3. Governance Architecture (Trust)
4. Agent Design (Capability)
5. Integration Patterns (Connection)
6. Measurement Systems (Learning)
7. Evolution Rituals (Growth)

Skip a layer → your AI initiative breaks under pressure.
