I got tired of:

• Losing my best prompts across sessions
• AI outputs that don't sound like me
• Juggling 10 different AI tools
• Starting from scratch every conversation

So I built an operating system.

Agentic Creator OS transforms Claude Code from a chat tool into a full creative studio.

The numbers:
• 25 commands
• 80+ skills
• 40+ specialized agents
• 8 orchestrated workflows
• Zero code required

The difference:

Chat Tool:
→ Ask questions, get answers, lose context

Operating System:
→ Persistent skills, coordinated agents, automated workflows

What ACOS gives you:

**Single Entry Point**
Just type `/acos` - the smart router figures out what you need.

**Auto-Activating Skills**
System detects your intent and loads the right capability.

**Quality Gates**
Hooks system enforces brand voice, code quality, security.

**Swarm Intelligence**
Multiple agents working in parallel on complex tasks.

This is the system behind:
• 12,000+ AI-generated songs
• This entire website
• Enterprise Oracle projects

Install in 5 minutes. Free on GitHub.
