What I learned building a 40+ agent system.

No single agent needs to be perfect. The swarm produces better results than any individual.

That's the core insight from 8 months of multi-agent development.

Single agent writing: "Write a blog post about AI"
Result: Generic, no depth, misses angles

Swarm writing:
- Research Agent gathers sources
- Strategy Agent identifies structure
- Writer Agent drafts in brand voice
- Editor Agent reviews clarity
- SEO Agent optimizes

Result: Publishable content, first try

The 4 orchestration patterns I use:

1. Pipeline (Sequential)
Research → Plan → Create → Edit → Publish
Each agent hands off to the next. Best for linear workflows.

2. Parallel (Concurrent)
[Agent A | Agent B | Agent C] → Synthesis
Multiple agents work simultaneously. Best when tasks are independent.

3. Weighted Synthesis (Expert Voting)
3 agents answer the same question. Orchestrator weighs their responses.
Best for important decisions where you want multiple perspectives.

4. Iterative (Refinement Loops)
Writer → Critic → Writer → Critic (until quality threshold)
Best for quality-sensitive content. Built-in improvement cycles.

The key:

You don't need all 4 patterns. Start with Pipeline. It handles 70% of use cases.

Add Parallel when you hit speed bottlenecks.
Add Weighted when you need reliability.
Add Iterative when quality matters more than speed.
