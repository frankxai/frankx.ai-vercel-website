## Post Copy

I built my own JARVIS.

Not a chatbot. Not another AI wrapper. An actual intelligence system that knows my work, remembers my preferences, and executes complex workflows without me explaining everything from scratch.

Took me 3 weeks to figure out the architecture. Here's what I learned:

Your Jarvis needs three layers:

Layer 1: Knowledge
One file called CLAUDE.md. It holds everything—your projects, your preferences, your past decisions. Claude reads it automatically. No more re-explaining context every session.

Layer 2: Execution
Skills for repeated workflows. I have /publish (full blog pipeline), /deploy (staging to production), /research (deep dive with sources). One command, complete execution.

Layer 3: Intelligence
The system learns. Every decision I make gets documented. Every workflow I optimize gets saved. In 30 days, it knew my patterns better than I did.

The result?

I manage 12,000+ AI-generated songs, this website, and enterprise consulting. All through natural language commands. "Publish the agent roadmap article" and it writes, optimizes, deploys.

The technology exists today. Claude Code + CLAUDE.md + MCP servers.

No fancy infrastructure. No enterprise contracts. Free tools, wired together right.

What would you automate first if you had your own Jarvis?
