7 patterns that separate toy demos from production agents.

I analyzed AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex, Azure AI Foundry, OpenAI Agents SDK, Anthropic Claude SDK, and Oracle ADK.

They all converge on the same 7 pillars:

1. Orchestration
Agents rarely work alone. You need multi-agent coordination. Supervisor-specialist. Swarm. Pipeline. Pick your pattern.

2. Memory
LLMs are stateless. Without memory, agents can't learn, can't remember context, can't maintain coherent conversations. You need short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic.

3. Guardrails
Production demands predictable behavior. Input validation. Output filtering. Behavioral boundaries. Agents with tools need constraints.

4. Observability
Can't improve what you can't measure. Tracing. Logging. Cost tracking per task. When an agent fails at 3am, you need to know why.

5. Security
Agents with tools are attack surfaces. Principle of least privilege. Audit trails. Secret management. Every tool call is a potential vulnerability.

6. Cost Management
Agentic workflows consume 10-100x more tokens than simple chat. Token budgets. Circuit breakers. Fallback models. Or you'll get surprised bills.

7. Lifecycle (AgentOps)
Agents are software. Treat them that way. Version control. Testing. CI/CD. A/B deployment. Rollback capability.

Gartner says 40% of enterprise apps will include AI agents by end of 2026.

The companies that understand these pillars will ship.

The rest will keep building demos.
