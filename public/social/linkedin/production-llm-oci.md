Most GenAI projects invest 90% effort on models and 10% on operations.

Production systems require the inverse.

The model is a dependency. The operating model is the product.

Here's the 5-Stage Maturity Framework for Production AI:

Stage 1: Experimental (ad-hoc, no governance)
Stage 2: Managed (basic monitoring, manual evaluation)
Stage 3: Defined (automated pipelines, cost tracking)
Stage 4: Quantified (SLOs, incident response, optimization)
Stage 5: Optimizing (continuous learning, self-healing)

Where does your organization sit?
