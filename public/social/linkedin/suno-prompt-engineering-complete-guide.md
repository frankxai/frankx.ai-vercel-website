500+ AI songs later, here's what actually works in Suno.

Most people type "make an epic song" and wonder why the output sounds generic.

The problem isn't Suno. It's how you're talking to it.

Key insight I learned the hard way:

Suno doesn't follow instructions. It captures vibes.

"Make the drums louder" won't work.
"Powerful driving drums" will.

The formula that works:

Genre + Tempo + Instruments + Vocals + Mood + Special Elements

Weak: "rock song with guitar"
Strong: "indie rock, driving energy, clean electric guitar arpeggios, raspy tenor vocals, nostalgic triumphant"

What each element does:

Genre: Be specific. Not "electronic" but "deep house" or "synthwave" or "ambient techno"

Tempo/Energy: "Slow gentle peaceful" vs "fast driving explosive"

Instruments: "clean electric guitar arpeggios, tight snare, deep 808 bass, atmospheric synth pads"

Vocals: "ethereal female soprano" vs "raspy male tenor" vs "whispered intimate"

Mood: "melancholic", "triumphant", "mysterious", "euphoric"

Special elements: "528Hz frequency", "vinyl crackle", "orchestral swells", "nature sounds"

The template I use for every track:

[genre], [tempo/energy], [2-3 instruments], [vocal style], [2-3 mood words]

Example: "indie folk, gentle acoustic, fingerpicked guitar warm piano, soft male vocals, nostalgic bittersweet intimate"
