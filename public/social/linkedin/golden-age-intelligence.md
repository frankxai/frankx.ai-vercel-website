We're entering the Golden Age of Intelligence.

Not because AI is getting smarter.

Because the humans who know how to orchestrate AI systems are pulling ahead at exponential rates.

The playbook for this era:

→ Flagship authority pieces (deep, comprehensive)
→ High-frequency micro-content (consistent presence)
→ Automation pipelines (scale without sacrificing quality)
→ Distribution loops (omnichannel reach)
→ Measurement rituals (compound improvement)

This is the 15,000-word operating system we're running.
